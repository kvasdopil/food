- ✅ list liked meals - **Implemented**: Favorites filter toggle (heart icon) in feed allows filtering to show only liked recipes. Works with tags and search.
- ✅ remove slider and 'next recipe' button, make it a simple 2-level structure on mobile and web
- add feed to 'recipe' view on desktop?
- add recipe via agent
  - secure token via vercel?
- hidden tags for meals, like 'simple', 'healthy', etc. for search and llm queries
- another variation of same meal, like vegeterian version of the same
- ssr
- ✅ proper loading preview for a recipe and feed - **Implemented**: Recipe pages show cached partial data immediately, feed shows cached recipes on reload
- preload next recipe on desktop
- search for meal components
- more refined filtering, with llm (vector?)
- fix refine endpoint response format inconsistency (when checks pass, return database format instead of RecipeData format for consistency)
- propose meal ideas in generate window
- make generate window a generate page
- stream llm generation output and populate generate result
- save creator's username
- add 'my recipes' page
- scenario:
  - generate 3 variations of the same meal
- scenario:
  - generate, then refine generated meal
- scenario:
  - take a meal, generate a variation (same but vegan/vegeterian/glutenfree/with chicken)
- scenario:
  - give me 5 meals for a week, i need 1 meat, 1 fish, others random
  - check liked, suggest new for the rest
  - when done, ask for list of ingridients, go back to (2) if needed
  - export list of ingridients
- scenario:
  - i know what i want to have, add this recipe to the db
  - user provides clarifications to generator until satisfied
  - image preview with nanobanana (quick!)
