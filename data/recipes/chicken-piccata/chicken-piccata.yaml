instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Prepare the sides. Place the diced *potatoes* and 2 minced *garlic* cloves
      in a medium saucepan. Cover with cold water, add a pinch of salt, and
      bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer for 15-20
      minutes, or until the potatoes are very tender.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Prepare the chicken. While the potatoes cook, thinly slice or pound the
      *chicken breasts* to about 1 cm thickness. Season the *plain flour* with a
      generous pinch of salt and black pepper on a shallow plate. Dredge each
      chicken cutlet in the seasoned flour, shaking off any excess.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Cook the chicken. Heat a drizzle of olive oil and 20g of *unsalted butter*
      in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Once the butter is melted and
      sizzling, add the floured *chicken* cutlets in a single layer (cook in
      batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding). Cook for 3-4 minutes per
      side, until golden brown and cooked through. Remove the cooked chicken to
      a plate and set aside, keeping it warm.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Make the piccata sauce. To the same frying pan, add the *chicken stock*,
      the juice of 1.5 *lemons*, and the drained *capers*. Bring to a simmer,
      scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Stir in the
      remaining 30g of *unsalted butter* until melted and the sauce slightly
      thickens. Return the cooked *chicken* to the pan, turning to coat in the
      sauce.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Finish the mashed potatoes. Drain the cooked *potatoes* and garlic well.
      Return them to the saucepan. Add the *warm milk* and the remaining 30g of
      *unsalted butter*. Mash until smooth and creamy. Season with salt and
      black pepper to taste.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Sauté the spinach. In a separate small frying pan, heat a drizzle of olive
      oil over medium heat. Add the remaining 1 minced *garlic* clove and cook
      for 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the *fresh spinach* and a pinch of
      salt. Sauté for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the spinach
      wilts.
  - step: 7
    action: >-
      Serve the meal. Divide the garlic mashed potatoes, sautéed spinach, and
      chicken piccata among plates. Spoon extra lemon caper sauce over the
      *chicken*. Garnish with the finely chopped *fresh parsley* and a few thin
      slices of the remaining *lemon*, if desired.
