instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat oven to 200°C. On a baking sheet, toss the *broccoli florets* with
      a drizzle of olive oil, half of the minced *garlic*, a pinch of salt, and
      a grind of black pepper. Roast for 15-20 minutes, or until tender-crisp
      and lightly browned.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the *fettuccine* and cook
      according to package directions until al dente. Reserve 120 ml of the
      pasta cooking water before draining the pasta.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      While the broccoli roasts and pasta cooks, heat a large skillet over
      medium-high heat. Add a drizzle of olive oil. Add the *large shrimp* and
      cook for 2-3 minutes per side, or until pink and opaque. Season with a
      pinch of salt and pepper. Remove the shrimp from the skillet and set
      aside.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      In the same skillet, reduce heat to medium. Melt the *unsalted butter*.
      Add the remaining minced *garlic* and cook for 30 seconds until fragrant.
      Pour in the *heavy cream* and bring to a gentle simmer, stirring
      occasionally.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Stir in the grated *parmesan cheese* until melted and the sauce is smooth
      and thickened. If the sauce is too thick, add a splash of the reserved
      pasta water until it reaches your desired consistency. Season the sauce
      with salt and black pepper to taste.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Add the cooked *fettuccine* and sautéed *large shrimp* to the sauce in the
      skillet. Toss gently to coat everything evenly. If using, squeeze in the
      juice from the *lemon*.
  - step: 7
    action: >-
      Serve the shrimp alfredo pasta immediately, topped with the roasted
      *broccoli florets* and a sprinkle of chopped *fresh parsley* if desired.
