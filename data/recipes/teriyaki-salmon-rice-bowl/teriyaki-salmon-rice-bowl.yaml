instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Rinse the *short-grain white rice* thoroughly under cold water until the
      water runs clear. Combine the rinsed *rice* and 300ml of *water* in a
      small saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and
      simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for
      another 10 minutes.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      While the rice cooks, prepare the teriyaki sauce and quick pickles. In a
      small bowl, whisk together the *soy sauce*, *mirin*, *brown sugar*, grated
      *fresh ginger*, and minced *garlic*. In a separate tiny bowl, combine the
      *cornstarch* with 15ml of *water* to create a slurry. For the quick
      pickles, thinly slice the *cucumber*. In another small bowl, whisk
      together the *rice vinegar* and 5g *sugar* until the sugar dissolves. Add
      the sliced *cucumber* and toss to coat.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Pat the *salmon fillets* dry with paper towels and season lightly with
      salt and pepper. Heat a drizzle of *vegetable oil* in a non-stick pan over
      medium-high heat. Place the *salmon fillets* skin-side down (if
      applicable) and sear for 4-5 minutes until the skin is crispy. Flip the
      *salmon* and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Pour the prepared teriyaki
      sauce over the *salmon*. Bring to a simmer, then stir in the *cornstarch
      slurry* and cook, stirring gently, until the sauce thickens and glazes the
      *salmon* (about 1-2 minutes). Remove from heat.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Cook the *frozen shelled edamame* according to package instructions
      (usually boiling for 3-5 minutes or microwaving). Drain well. For the miso
      soup, dissolve the *dashi powder* in 300ml of *hot water* in a small pot.
      Whisk in the *miso paste* until fully dissolved (do not boil after adding
      miso). Add the cubed *silken tofu* and gently warm through.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      To assemble the bowls, fluff the cooked *rice* with a fork and divide it
      among serving bowls. Top each bowl with a *teriyaki salmon fillet*, a
      portion of the *edamame*, and some of the quick-pickled *cucumber*.
      Garnish with sliced *spring onion* and *toasted sesame seeds*. Serve
      immediately with the warm *miso soup* on the side.
