instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat oven to 200°C. Wash and chop *potatoes* into 2-3 cm pieces. Toss
      them with a drizzle of olive oil, a pinch of salt, and black pepper on a
      baking tray. Roast for 30-35 minutes, or until golden and tender, flipping
      halfway.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      While potatoes roast, prepare the tzatziki. Grate the *cucumber* and
      squeeze out as much excess water as possible using a clean cloth or paper
      towel. Mince 2 cloves of *garlic*. In a small bowl, combine the *greek
      yogurt*, grated cucumber, minced garlic, *fresh dill*, and *red wine
      vinegar*. Add a small drizzle of olive oil, salt, and pepper to taste. Mix
      well and set aside in the fridge.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Prepare the lamb chops. Zest half of the *lemon* and juice the entire
      lemon (keeping the other half of the zest for garnish if desired). Mince
      the remaining 2 cloves of *garlic*. In a small bowl, combine the *dried
      oregano*, minced garlic, lemon zest, a pinch of salt, and black pepper.
      Add a drizzle of olive oil to form a paste.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Pat the *lamb chops* dry with paper towels. Rub the oregano-garlic mixture
      all over the lamb chops, ensuring they are well coated. Heat a large
      frying pan or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat with a drizzle of
      olive oil until shimmering.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Sear the lamb chops for 3-4 minutes per side for medium-rare, or longer
      for desired doneness. Cook in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding
      the pan. Once cooked, remove the lamb chops from the pan and let them rest
      on a cutting board for 5 minutes.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Serve the rested *lamb chops* immediately with the roasted potatoes and a
      generous dollop of tzatziki. Drizzle with fresh lemon juice from the
      remaining lemon half.
