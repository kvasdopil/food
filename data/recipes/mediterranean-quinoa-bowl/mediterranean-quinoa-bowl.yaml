      Rinse quinoa thoroughly under cold water. In a medium saucepan, combine
      the rinsed quinoa, vegetable stock, 5 ml olive oil, and 2 g salt. Bring to
      a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes, or
      until all liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for
      5 minutes. Fluff with a fork and stir in chopped parsley and mint.

      While quinoa cooks, prepare the Lemon Tahini Dressing: Whisk together
      tahini, 30 ml lemon juice, minced garlic, 15 ml olive oil, 2 g salt, and 1
      g black pepper in a small bowl. Gradually add cold water, starting with 60
      ml, whisking until smooth and desired consistency is reached (add up to 30
      ml more water if needed).

      Prepare the main bowl components: In a large bowl, combine the halved
