instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat oven to 200Â°C. Slice *eggplant* into 1 cm rounds. Lightly salt the
      *eggplant* slices and let them sit for 10 minutes to draw out moisture,
      then pat them thoroughly dry with paper towels.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Set up a breading station with three shallow dishes: one with *all-purpose
      flour*, one with the *beaten eggs*, and one with *breadcrumbs*. Season the
      flour and breadcrumbs with a pinch of salt and pepper.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Dredge each *eggplant* slice first in the *flour*, shaking off excess,
      then dip in the *beaten eggs*, and finally coat well in the *breadcrumbs*.
      Heat a generous drizzle of olive oil in a large pan over medium-high heat.
      Fry the *breaded eggplant* in batches for 2-3 minutes per side until
      golden brown. Remove and place on a wire rack lined with paper towels to
      drain excess oil.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Spread a thin layer of *marinara sauce* on the bottom of a 20x30 cm baking
      dish. Arrange a single layer of *fried eggplant* slices over the sauce.
      Top with a sprinkle of *minced garlic* (from 1 clove), a layer of
      *shredded mozzarella*, and a sprinkle of *grated Parmesan*. Repeat layers
      until all *eggplant* is used, finishing with a generous layer of *marinara
      sauce*, *mozzarella*, and *Parmesan*.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Bake the *eggplant parmesan* for 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is
      melted and bubbly and the top is golden brown.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      While the eggplant bakes, prepare the garlic bread. Mince the remaining
      *garlic cloves*. In a small bowl, combine the *softened butter* with the
      *minced garlic*. Slice the *ciabatta or baguette* lengthwise or into thick
      slices. Spread the *garlic butter* generously on the bread.
  - step: 7
    action: >-
      Place the *garlic bread* directly on the oven rack during the last 8-10
      minutes of the eggplant's baking time, or until golden and crisp.
  - step: 8
    action: >-
      Let the *eggplant parmesan* rest for a few minutes before serving. Garnish
      with fresh *basil leaves* if desired. Serve hot with the warm *garlic
      bread*.
