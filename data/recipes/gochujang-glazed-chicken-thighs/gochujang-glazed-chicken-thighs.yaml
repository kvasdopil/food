instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). In a medium bowl, whisk together gochujang,
      soy sauce, honey, rice vinegar, minced garlic, grated ginger, and 1
      teaspoon sesame oil to create the glaze.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Pat chicken thighs dry. Place them on a foil-lined baking sheet. Brush
      about half of the gochujang glaze generously over both sides of the
      chicken. Bake for 15 minutes.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      While the chicken bakes, prepare the kimchi fried rice. Heat 1 tablespoon
      vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the
      chopped kimchi and sauté for 2-3 minutes. Add the day-old rice and kimchi
      juice, stirring to combine and break up any clumps. Cook for 5-7 minutes,
      stirring occasionally, until the rice is heated through and slightly
      crispy. Push rice to one side, crack the egg into the empty side,
      scramble, then mix into the rice. Stir in a dash of sesame oil.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      After 15 minutes, remove chicken from the oven. Brush the remaining glaze
      over the chicken. Return to the oven and bake for another 10-15 minutes,
      or until the chicken is cooked through (internal temperature reaches
      165°F/74°C) and the glaze is sticky and lacquered.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Remove chicken from oven. Let rest for a few minutes. Serve the Gochujang
      Glazed Chicken Thighs over the glossy kimchi fried rice, garnished with
      toasted sesame seeds and sliced green onions.
