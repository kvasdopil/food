instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat the oven to 200°C. In a medium bowl, whisk together *gochujang*, *soy sauce*, *honey*, *rice vinegar*,
      *minced garlic*, *grated fresh ginger*, and 1 tsp *sesame oil* to create the glaze.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Pat *boneless, skinless chicken thighs* dry. Place them on a foil-lined baking sheet. Brush about half of the gochujang glaze
      generously over both sides of the chicken. Bake for 15 minutes.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      While the chicken bakes, prepare the kimchi fried rice. Heat 1 tbsp *vegetable oil* in a large skillet or wok over
      medium-high heat. Add the *kimchi, chopped* and sauté for 2-3 minutes. Add the *cooked day-old rice* and *kimchi
      juice*, stirring to combine and break up any clumps. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the rice is
      heated through and slightly crispy. Push rice to one side, crack the *large egg* into the empty side, scramble,
      then mix into the rice. Stir in a dash of *sesame oil*.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      After 15 minutes, remove chicken from the oven. Brush the remaining glaze over the chicken. Return to the oven and
      bake for another 10-15 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through (internal temperature reaches 74°C) and the
      glaze is sticky and lacquered.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Remove chicken from oven. Let rest for a few minutes. Serve the gochujang-glazed boneless, skinless chicken
      thighs over the glossy kimchi fried rice, garnished with *toasted sesame seeds* and *green onions, sliced*.
