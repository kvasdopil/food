instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Prepare the paneer marinade: In a large bowl, combine *plain yogurt*,
      *ginger garlic paste*, *lemon juice*, *turmeric powder*, *red chilli
      powder*, *cumin powder*, *coriander powder*, *garam masala*, and a pinch
      of *salt*. Mix well to form a smooth marinade.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Marinate the paneer: Add the cubed *paneer* to the yogurt marinade,
      ensuring each piece is fully coated. Cover the bowl and let it marinate at
      room temperature for at least 15 minutes, or refrigerate for up to 30
      minutes.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Prepare vegetables and rice: While the paneer marinates, chop the *bell
      peppers* and *onion* into roughly 2.5 cm pieces. Rinse the *basmati rice*
      under cold water until the water runs clear. In a small saucepan, add the
      rice, 400 ml of water, and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce
      heat to low, cover, and simmer for 12-15 minutes until water is absorbed.
      Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Prepare cumin rice: After the rice has rested, add *cumin seeds* to a dry
      pan and toast for 30 seconds until fragrant. Stir the toasted cumin seeds
      into the cooked basmati rice with a fork to fluff.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Assemble skewers: If using *wooden skewers*, ensure they have been soaked.
      Thread alternating pieces of marinated *paneer*, *bell peppers*, and
      *onion* onto the skewers until all ingredients are used. You should have
      8-10 skewers.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Cook the skewers: Heat 1 tbsp of *vegetable oil* in a large non-stick pan
      or grill pan over medium-high heat. Place the *paneer tikka skewers* in
      the pan, ensuring not to overcrowd. Cook for 3-4 minutes per side, turning
      occasionally, until the *paneer* is lightly charred and the vegetables are
      tender-crisp. You may need to cook in batches. Alternatively, grill on a
      BBQ for similar times.
  - step: 7
    action: >-
      Serve: Serve the hot *paneer tikka skewers* immediately alongside the
      fragrant *cumin basmati rice*. Garnish with a sprinkle of fresh coriander
      if desired.
