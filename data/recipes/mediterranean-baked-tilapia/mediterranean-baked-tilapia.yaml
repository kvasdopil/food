      *garlic cloves*. Slice half of the *lemon* into thin rounds. Pat *tilapia
      fillets* dry with paper towels.

    action: >-
      On the prepared baking tray, arrange the *tilapia fillets*. Scatter the
      halved *cherry tomatoes* and chopped *kalamata olives* around the
      tilapia fillets. Sprinkle the minced *garlic cloves* and *dried oregano* over the fish
      and vegetables. Drizzle with a generous amount of *olive oil*. Season with
      a pinch of salt and black pepper. Place the *lemon* slices on top of the
      tilapia fillets.

      Grate the *cauliflower* florets into rice-like pieces using a box grater
      or food processor. Mince the remaining 1 *garlic cloves*. Chop the *fresh
      parsley*. Heat a drizzle of *olive oil* in a large pan over medium heat.
      Add the minced garlic cloves and sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the
      grated *cauliflower* to the pan. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring
      occasionally, until tender-crisp. Squeeze the juice from the remaining

      Bake the *tilapia fillets* in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes, or until the

      *lemon* slices from the tilapia fillets. Serve the Mediterranean baked tilapia
      immediately over the lemon herb cauliflower rice. Garnish with the
      remaining chopped *fresh parsley*.
