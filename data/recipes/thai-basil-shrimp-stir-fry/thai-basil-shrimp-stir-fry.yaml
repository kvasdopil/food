      Prepare the coconut rice: Rinse the *jasmine rice* under cold water until
      the water runs clear. In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed *jasmine
      rice* with *coconut milk* and 150 ml of water. Bring to a boil, then
      reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes. Remove from heat
      and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Prepare stir-fry ingredients: While the rice cooks, mince the *garlic* and
      thinly slice the *red chilies*. Thinly slice the *shallots* and *red bell
      pepper*. In a small bowl, whisk together the *soy sauce*, *fish sauce*,
      *oyster sauce*, and *sugar* to create the stir-fry sauce.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Stir-fry aromatics: Heat a drizzle of *vegetable oil* in a large wok or
      frying pan over high heat until shimmering. Add the sliced *shallots*,

      until the vegetables are crisp-tender.
