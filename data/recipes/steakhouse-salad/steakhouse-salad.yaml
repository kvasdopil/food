instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat oven to 200Â°C. Halve the *fingerling potatoes* and toss them with
      30 ml of *olive oil*, salt, and black pepper. Spread them on a baking tray
      and roast for 30-35 minutes, or until tender and lightly browned.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      While potatoes roast, prepare the balsamic glaze and dressing. For the
      glaze, pour 30 ml of *balsamic vinegar* into a small saucepan and bring to
      a simmer over medium heat. Reduce by half until slightly thickened (about
      5-7 minutes). Set aside. For the dressing, whisk together the remaining 30
      ml of balsamic vinegar, 60 ml of *olive oil*, *dijon mustard*, *honey*
      (if using), salt, and black pepper in a small bowl.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Prepare the salad components and steak. Wash the *mixed salad greens*.
      Halve the *cherry tomatoes*. Thinly slice the *red onion*. Crumble the
      *blue cheese*. Pat the *sirloin steak* dry with paper towels and season
      generously with salt and black pepper.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Heat a heavy-bottomed pan or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat with
      a drizzle of *olive oil*. Once hot, sear the *sirloin steak* for 3-4 minutes
      per side for medium-rare, or longer to your desired doneness. Remove the
      steak from the pan and let it rest on a cutting board for 5 minutes.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Arrange the *mixed salad greens*, *cherry tomatoes*, *red onion*, *blue
      cheese*, and warm *roasted fingerling potatoes* on individual plates.
      Slice the rested *sirloin steak* thinly against the grain and place it
      over the salad components. Drizzle generously with the prepared dressing
      and the *balsamic glaze* before serving.
