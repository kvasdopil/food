instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat oven to 200Â°C. Toss the trimmed asparagus spears with 1 tablespoon
      of olive oil, a pinch of salt, and pepper on a baking tray. Roast for
      10-12 minutes until tender-crisp. Set aside.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, melt 15g of butter with the
      remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped
      onion and cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the
      minced garlic and cook for another minute until fragrant.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Add the Arborio rice to the pot and stir constantly for 2 minutes until
      the edges of the grains are translucent but the center is still opaque. If
      using, pour in the white wine and stir until it has been completely
      absorbed by the rice.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Begin adding the warm vegetable broth, one ladleful (about 120ml) at a
      time, stirring frequently. Wait until each addition of broth is almost
      completely absorbed before adding the next. After about 10 minutes of
      adding broth, stir in the sliced mushrooms.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Continue adding broth and stirring for another 10-15 minutes, or until the
      rice is creamy and al dente (cooked through but still firm to the bite).
      You may not need all of the broth. Remove the pot from the heat.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Stir in the remaining 15g of butter and the grated Parmesan cheese until
      melted and fully incorporated. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
      Let the risotto rest for 2 minutes, covered.
  - step: 7
    action: >-
      Serve the creamy mushroom risotto immediately, garnished with fresh
      chopped parsley and accompanied by the roasted asparagus spears. A squeeze
      of fresh lemon over the asparagus is highly recommended.
