instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat oven to 200Â°C. Toss the trimmed *asparagus* spears with 1 tbsp of *olive oil*, a pinch of *salt*, and
      *black pepper* on a baking tray. Roast for 10-12 minutes until tender-crisp. Set aside.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven, melt 15 g of *unsalted butter* with the remaining 1 tbsp of *olive
      oil* over medium heat. Add the chopped *yellow onion* and cook until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes.
      Add the minced *garlic* and cook for another minute until fragrant.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Add the *arborio rice* to the pot and stir constantly for 2 minutes until the edges of the grains are translucent
      but the center is still opaque. If using, pour in the *dry white wine* and stir until it has been completely
      absorbed by the rice.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Begin adding the warm *vegetable broth*, one ladleful (about 120 ml) at a time, stirring frequently. Wait until
      each addition of broth is almost completely absorbed before adding the next. After about 10 minutes of adding
      broth, stir in the sliced *cremini or button mushrooms*.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Continue adding *vegetable broth* and stirring for another 10-15 minutes, or until the *arborio rice* is creamy
      and al dente (cooked through but still firm to the bite). You may not need all of the broth. Remove the pot from
      the heat.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Stir in the remaining 15 g of *unsalted butter* and the grated *parmesan cheese* until melted and fully
      incorporated. season with *salt* and *black pepper* to taste. Let the risotto rest for 2 minutes, covered.
  - step: 7
    action: >-
      Serve the creamy *cremini or button mushrooms* risotto immediately, garnished with chopped *fresh parsley* and
      accompanied by the roasted *asparagus* spears. A squeeze of *lemon* over the asparagus is highly recommended.
