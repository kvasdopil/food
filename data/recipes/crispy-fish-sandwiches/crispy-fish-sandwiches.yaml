instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat your oven to 200°C. Wash and cut the *potatoes* into fry-like
      sticks. Toss them with a drizzle of *olive oil*, a pinch of *salt*, and
      *black pepper* on a baking tray. Spread them in a single layer and bake
      for 25-30 minutes, flipping halfway, until golden and crispy.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      While the fries bake, prepare the tartar sauce. In a small bowl, combine
      the *mayonnaise*, finely chopped *gherkins*, *fresh dill* (if using), and
      *lemon juice*. Season with a pinch of *salt* and *black pepper*, then stir
      well and set aside.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Pat the *cod fillets* dry with paper towels. Set up a breading station:
      place the *plain flour* on one plate, whisk the *large egg* in a shallow
      bowl, and put the *panko breadcrumbs* on another plate. Season the *flour*
      with a pinch of salt and pepper. Dredge each *fish fillet* first in the
      flour, shaking off excess, then dip in the egg, and finally coat
      thoroughly in the breadcrumbs, pressing gently to adhere.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Heat the *vegetable oil* in a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat
      until shimmering (about 170°C). Carefully place 2 *breaded fish fillets*
      into the hot oil, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan. Fry for 3-4 minutes
      per side, until golden brown and cooked through. Remove and place on a
      wire rack lined with paper towels to drain excess oil. Repeat with the
      remaining fish fillets. Lightly toast the *burger buns* in the oven during
      the last few minutes of the fries' cooking time, or in a dry pan.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      To assemble the sandwiches, spread a generous spoonful of the prepared
      *tartar sauce* on both halves of each toasted *burger bun*. Place a
      *lettuce* leaf on the bottom bun, top with a crispy *fish fillet*, and
      then add the top bun. Serve immediately with the hot oven-baked fries.
