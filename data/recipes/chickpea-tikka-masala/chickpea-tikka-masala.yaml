instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Rinse the *basmati rice* thoroughly under cold water until the water runs clear. Place the rice in a small
      saucepan with 400 ml of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 12-15 minutes, or
      until all water is absorbed. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      While the *rice* cooks, heat the *vegetable oil* in a large saucepan or pot over medium heat. Add the chopped
      *onion* and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened and translucent.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Add the minced *garlic* and grated *ginger* to the pot. Cook for another 1 minute until fragrant. Stir in the

      constantly, until the spices are aromatic.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Pour in the *crushed tomatoes* and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Add the drained and rinsed *chickpeas*.

  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Stir in the *coconut milk* and *garam masala*. If using, add the *sugar* to balance the acidity of the *tomatoes*.
      Season with *salt* to taste. Continue to simmer gently, uncovered, for another 5 minutes, until the sauce has
      thickened slightly and is heated through.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      While the curry simmers, prepare the *cucumber* salad: In a small bowl, combine the diced cucumber with the *lemon
      juice* and a pinch of *salt*. Toss gently.

      Fluff the cooked *basmati rice* with a fork. Taste the chickpea tikka masala and adjust seasoning if necessary.
