instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Rinse the basmati rice thoroughly under cold water until the water runs
      clear. Place the rice in a small saucepan with 400 millilitres of water.
      Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 12-15
      minutes, or until all water is absorbed. Remove from heat and let stand,
      covered, for 5 minutes.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      While the rice cooks, heat the vegetable oil in a large saucepan or pot
      over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring
      occasionally, until softened and translucent.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Add the minced garlic and grated ginger to the pot. Cook for another 1
      minute until fragrant. Stir in the ground cumin, ground coriander,
      turmeric powder, and chilli powder. Cook for 30 seconds, stirring
      constantly, until the spices are aromatic.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Pour in the crushed tomatoes and bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Add
      the drained and rinsed chickpeas. Stir well, then reduce the heat to low,
      cover, and let simmer for 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Stir in the coconut milk and garam masala. If using, add the sugar to
      balance the acidity of the tomatoes. Season with salt to taste. Continue
      to simmer gently, uncovered, for another 5 minutes, until the sauce has
      thickened slightly and is heated through.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      While the curry simmers, prepare the cucumber salad: In a small bowl,
      combine the diced cucumber with the lemon juice and a pinch of salt. Toss
      gently.
  - step: 7
    action: >-
      Fluff the cooked basmati rice with a fork. Taste the Chickpea Tikka Masala
      and adjust seasoning if necessary.
