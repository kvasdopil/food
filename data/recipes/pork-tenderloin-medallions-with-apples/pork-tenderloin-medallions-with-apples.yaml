instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Prepare the side dish: Place the *potatoes* in a pot, cover with cold
      water, and add a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and
      simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until very tender. Drain well, return to the
      pot, and mash with the warmed *milk* and 15 g of the *unsalted butter*.
      Season with *salt* and *black pepper* to taste. Keep warm.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Season the *pork tenderloin* medallions generously with *salt* and *black
      pepper*. Heat a large, heavy-bottomed pan or cast-iron skillet over
      medium-high heat. Add a drizzle of *olive oil*. Once hot, sear the pork
      medallions for 2-3 minutes per side, until golden brown and cooked
      through (internal temperature 63°C). Remove the pork from the pan and set
      aside on a plate, tented with foil.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 15 g of *unsalted butter* to
      the pan. Add the sliced *apples* and diced *onion*. Sauté for 5-7 minutes,
      stirring occasionally, until the *apples* are tender-crisp and the *onion*
      is softened and translucent.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Pour in the *dry apple cider* and *chicken stock* into the pan, scraping
      up any browned bits from the bottom. Bring to a simmer and stir in the
      *dijon mustard* and chopped *fresh thyme*. Continue to simmer for 3-5
      minutes, until the sauce slightly thickens. Taste and adjust *salt* and
      *black pepper* as needed.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Return the seared *pork tenderloin* medallions to the pan with the sauce and
      *apples*, turning to coat. Let it warm through for 1-2 minutes. Serve the
      pork tenderloin medallions with apples and sauce immediately over the
      creamy *potatoes*.
