instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Heat a small dry pan over medium heat. Add the *pine nuts* and toast for
      2-3 minutes, stirring frequently, until golden brown and fragrant. Remove
      from the pan and set aside.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add the *pasta* and
      cook according to package directions until al dente. Before draining,
      reserve the *reserved pasta water*. Drain the pasta and set aside.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      While the *pasta* cooks, heat the *olive oil* in a large saucepan or deep
      frying pan over medium heat. Add the chopped *onion* and cook for 5-7
      minutes until softened and translucent. Add the minced *garlic* and cook
      for another minute until fragrant. Add the drained *jarred roasted red
      peppers* to the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Carefully transfer the roasted *pepper* mixture from the pan to a blender.
      Add the *vegetable stock*, or a splash of *reserved pasta water* for a
      lighter sauce. Blend until completely smooth and creamy. Season the sauce
      with *salt* and *black pepper* to taste.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Return the sauce to the saucepan over low heat. Add the cooked *pasta* and
      toss to coat evenly. If the sauce is too thick, add a little more
      *reserved pasta water* until it reaches your desired consistency. Stir in
      the chopped *fresh basil* and the grated *parmesan cheese*.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Divide the *pasta* among serving plates. Garnish with the toasted *pine
      nuts* and *fresh basil*. In a small bowl, toss the *rocket* with a drizzle
      of *olive oil* and *balsamic vinegar*, then serve alongside the pasta.
