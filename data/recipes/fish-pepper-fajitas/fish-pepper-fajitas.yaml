instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Pat *fish fillets* dry and cut into 2 cm strips. In a small bowl, combine
      *chili powder*, *ground cumin*, *smoked paprika*, *garlic powder*, *salt*,
      and *black pepper*. Drizzle fish fillets with a little *olive oil* and
      toss with half of the spice mixture until evenly coated. Set aside.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Heat 1 tbsp of *olive oil* in a large skillet or frying pan over
      medium-high heat. Add the sliced *bell peppers* and *onion* to the pan.
      Sauté for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the *vegetables* are
      tender-crisp. Add the remaining half of the *spice mixture* and stir for
      another minute until fragrant. Remove the *peppers* and *onion* from the
      pan and set aside.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Add another drizzle of *olive oil* to the same skillet. Increase heat to
      high. Once hot, add the seasoned *fish fillets* in a single layer, working
      in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding. Cook for 2-3 minutes per
      side, until the *fish fillets* are opaque and cooked through and lightly browned.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Return the *sautéed peppers and onion* to the skillet with the *cooked
      fish fillets*. Squeeze the juice from one *limes* over the mixture and toss gently
      to combine. Warm the *small flour tortillas* according to package
      instructions (e.g., in a dry skillet, microwave, or oven). Serve the
      sizzling *fish and pepper fajita* mixture immediately with the warm
      *small flour tortillas*, rinsed *black beans*, and *limes*.
