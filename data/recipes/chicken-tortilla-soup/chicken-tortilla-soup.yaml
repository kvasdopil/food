    action: >-
      Prep the chicken: Place *chicken breast* in a pot, cover with water, and
      boil for 15-20 minutes until cooked through. Remove, let cool slightly,
      then shred using two forks. Reserve the cooking liquid if desired for
      extra broth.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Prepare tortilla strips: Slice *corn tortillas* into thin strips (approx.
      0.5 cm wide). Heat *vegetable oil* in a large pan over medium-high heat.
      Fry tortilla strips in batches until golden and crispy. Remove with a
      slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. Season lightly with salt.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Sauté aromatics and build broth: In a large pot, sauté chopped *onion* and
      minced *garlic* in a drizzle of oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Add
      *chili powder* and *cumin*, cook for 1 minute until fragrant. Pour in
      *chicken broth* and *canned diced tomatoes*. Bring to a simmer.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Combine and finish soup: Add the shredded chicken and *canned corn* to the
      simmering broth. Cook for 5-7 minutes to allow flavors to meld. Squeeze in
      the juice of half a *lime*. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Prepare avocado salad: While the soup simmers, dice *avocados* and chop
      *coriander*. In a small bowl, gently combine the diced avocado, chopped
      coriander, and the juice of the remaining half lime. Season with a pinch
      of salt.
  - step: 6

      Serve: Ladle hot soup into bowls. Garnish generously with crispy tortilla
      strips and a spoonful of the avocado salad.
