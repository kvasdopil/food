instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      In a small bowl, combine the julienned *carrot* and *daikon radish*. Pour
      over the *rice vinegar for pickling*, the *caster sugar for pickling*, and
      60 ml of warm water. Stir well and set aside to pickle while you prepare
      other components.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Thinly slice the *pork loin*. In a separate bowl, whisk together the *soy
      sauce*, the *fish sauce*, the *caster sugar for pork marinade*, the minced
      *garlic cloves*, and the grated *fresh ginger*. Add the pork slices to the
      marinade, ensuring they are well coated. Let marinate for at least 10
      minutes.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      For the sesame cucumber salad, slice half of the *cucumber* into thin
      half-moons. In a small bowl, whisk together the *rice vinegar for cucumber salad*,
      the *caster sugar for cucumber salad*, and the *sesame oil*. Toss the
      cucumber slices with this dressing and sprinkle with *sesame seeds*. For
      the sriracha mayo, simply mix the *mayonnaise* and *sriracha* in a small
      bowl.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Heat a drizzle of oil in a frying pan over medium-high heat. Add the
      marinated pork slices in a single layer (cook in batches if necessary) and
      cook for 2-3 minutes per side, until browned and cooked through. Remove
      from heat and set aside.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Slice the *crusty baguette* lengthwise, without cutting all the way
      through. Lightly toast the baguette halves in a dry pan or under a grill
      for a minute or two until slightly crispy. Spread a generous layer of
      sriracha mayo on both sides of the baguette.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Layer the cooked pork, drained pickled vegetables, fresh cucumber slices
      (from the remaining half), *fresh coriander*, and *fresh red chilli*
      slices (if using) inside the baguette. Serve immediately with the sesame
      cucumber salad on the side.
