instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Prepare the chicken marinade: In a bowl, combine the sliced *chicken
      breast* with *fajita seasoning*, the juice of half a *lime*, minced
      *garlic*, a pinch of *salt*, and *black pepper*. Toss to coat and set aside
      while you prepare the rice and vegetables.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Cook the cilantro rice: Rinse the *long-grain white rice* under cold
      water. In a small saucepan, combine the *rice* and *water or chicken
      broth*. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15
      minutes. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff
      with a fork, then stir in half the chopped *cilantro* and the juice from
      the remaining half *lime*.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Sear the chicken: Heat a large skillet (cast iron works best) over
      medium-high heat with a drizzle of *olive oil*. Add the marinated *chicken
      breast* in a single layer, ensuring not to overcrowd the pan (cook in
      batches if necessary). Cook for 3-4 minutes per side, until browned and
      cooked through. Remove the *chicken* from the skillet and set aside.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Sauté the vegetables: In the same skillet, add another small drizzle of
      *olive oil* if needed. Add the sliced *bell peppers* and *onion*. Sauté
      for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are
      tender-crisp and slightly charred.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Combine and serve: Return the cooked *chicken* to the skillet with the
      *bell peppers* and *onion*. Toss everything together to combine and heat
      through for 1-2 minutes. Serve immediately with warm *small flour
      tortillas*, the prepared *cilantro rice*, and the remaining fresh
      *cilantro* for garnish.
