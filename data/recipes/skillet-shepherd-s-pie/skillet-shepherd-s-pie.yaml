instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Place *potatoes* in a large pot, cover with cold water, and add a pinch of
      salt. Bring to a boil and cook for 15-20 minutes, or until very tender.
      Drain well.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      While potatoes cook, heat a drizzle of *olive oil* in a large oven-safe
      skillet (e.g., 25 cm cast iron) over medium-high heat. Add *onion* and
      *carrots*, cook for 5-7 minutes until softened. Add *lean ground beef*,
      break it apart with a spoon, and cook until browned, about 8-10 minutes.
      Drain any excess fat. Stir in *tomato paste*, *dried thyme*, *salt*, and
      *black pepper*. Cook for 1 minute. Sprinkle *plain flour* (or cornstarch)
      over the mixture and stir for 1 minute. Pour in *beef broth* and
      *Worcestershire sauce* (if using), bring to a simmer, stirring until the
      sauce thickens. Stir in *frozen peas*. Remove from heat.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Return drained *potatoes* to the hot pot. Add *milk* and 15 g of *butter*.
      Mash until smooth and creamy. Season with *salt* and *black pepper* to
      taste.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Preheat oven to 190Â°C. Evenly spread the *beef and vegetable mixture* in
      the skillet. Carefully spoon the *mashed potatoes* over the beef mixture,
      spreading it to the edges. You can create peaks with a fork for a crispier
      top. Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the
      filling is bubbly.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Let the *skillet shepherd's pie* rest for a few minutes before serving.
      Meanwhile, melt the remaining 15 g of *butter* and toss with additional
      *frozen peas* (if desired for a side). Serve hot.
