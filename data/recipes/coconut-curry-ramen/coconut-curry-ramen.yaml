instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Press excess water from the *tofu* block. Cut into roughly 2 cm cubes. Heat half of the vegetable *oil* in a large
      pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add tofu cubes and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and
      crispy on all sides, about 10-15 minutes. Remove tofu from the pot and set aside.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      In the same pot, add the remaining *oil* if needed. Add diced *onion* and cook until softened, about 3-4 minutes.
      Stir in minced *garlic* and grated *ginger*, cooking for another minute until fragrant. Add *red curry paste* and
      cook, stirring constantly, for 1-2 minutes to toast the spices.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Pour in the *vegetable broth* and *coconut milk*. Bring to a gentle simmer, then reduce heat to low and let it
      simmer for 10-15 minutes to allow flavors to meld. Stir in *soy sauce* and *lime juice*. Taste and adjust
      seasonings as needed.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      While the *broth* simmers, cook the *ramen noodles* according to package directions in a separate pot of boiling
      water. Drain well. Add the halved *baby bok choy* to the simmering curry broth during the last 2-3 minutes of
      cooking, just until wilted and tender-crisp.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      In a small bowl, combine sliced *cucumber*, *rice vinegar*, *toasted sesame oil*, and *sesame seeds*. Toss gently
      to combine.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Divide the cooked *ramen noodles* among serving bowls. Ladle the hot coconut curry *broth* and *bok choy* over the
      noodles. Top each bowl with the crispy *tofu* cubes. Garnish with *fresh cilantro or green onions*, if desired.
      Serve immediately with the sesame *cucumber* salad on the side.
