instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Press excess water from the tofu block. Cut into 1-inch cubes. Heat 2
      tablespoons vegetable oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high
      heat. Add tofu cubes and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown
      and crispy on all sides, about 10-15 minutes. Remove tofu from the pot and
      set aside.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      In the same pot, if needed, add a touch more oil. Add diced onion and cook
      until softened, about 3-4 minutes. Stir in minced garlic and grated
      ginger, cooking for another minute until fragrant. Add red curry paste and
      cook, stirring constantly, for 1-2 minutes to toast the spices.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Pour in the vegetable broth and coconut milk. Bring to a gentle simmer,
      then reduce heat to low and let it simmer for 10-15 minutes to allow
      flavors to meld. Stir in soy sauce and lime juice. Taste and adjust
      seasonings as needed.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      While the broth simmers, cook the ramen noodles according to package
      directions in a separate pot of boiling water. Drain well. Add the halved
      baby bok choy to the simmering curry broth during the last 2-3 minutes of
      cooking, just until wilted and tender-crisp.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      In a small bowl, combine sliced cucumber, rice vinegar, toasted sesame
      oil, and sesame seeds. Toss gently to combine.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Divide the cooked ramen noodles among serving bowls. Ladle the hot coconut
      curry broth and bok choy over the noodles. Top each bowl with the crispy
      tofu cubes. Garnish with fresh cilantro or green onions, if desired. Serve
      immediately with the sesame cucumber salad on the side.
