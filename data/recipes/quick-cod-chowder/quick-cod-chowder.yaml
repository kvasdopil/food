instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat oven to 200Â°C. On a baking tray, toss *broccoli florets* and
      *cherry tomatoes* with a drizzle of *olive oil*, salt, and pepper. Roast for
      15-20 minutes until tender and slightly charred. Set aside.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      While vegetables roast, heat 1 tbsp *olive oil* in a large pot or Dutch oven
      over medium heat. Add the *onion* and cook for 5-7 minutes until softened.
      Add *garlic* and cook for another minute until fragrant.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Stir in the diced *potatoes* and *vegetable stock*. Bring to a simmer,
      then reduce heat, cover, and cook for 10-12 minutes, or until potatoes are
      tender when pierced with a fork.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Add the *cod fillets* to the pot, submerging them in the liquid. Pour in
      the *full-fat milk* and *sweet corn*. Gently simmer for 5-7 minutes, or
      until the cod is cooked through and flakes easily. Be careful not to boil,
      as this can curdle the milk.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Remove the cod from the pot and gently flake it into bite-sized pieces
      using a fork. Return the flaked cod to the chowder. Stir in the *fresh
      dill*. Season generously with salt and pepper to taste.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      For the roasted veggie salad dressing, whisk together 1 tbsp *olive oil* and
      a squeeze of lemon juice. Toss the warm roasted broccoli and cherry
      tomatoes with the dressing. Serve the hot cod chowder immediately,
      garnished with extra fresh dill, alongside the warm roasted veggie salad.
