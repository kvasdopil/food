instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Prepare the potatoes: Place the peeled and quartered *potatoes* in a large
      pot and cover with cold, salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat,
      then reduce heat to medium and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until
      fork-tender. Drain well and set aside.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Sear the salmon: Pat the *salmon fillets* dry with paper towels and season
      generously with salt and black pepper. Heat a drizzle of *olive oil* in a
      large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the salmon, skin-side
      down if applicable, and sear for 4-5 minutes per side, or until cooked
      through and flaky. Remove the salmon from the skillet and set aside on a
      plate.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Make the Tuscan sauce: Reduce the heat to medium. If needed, add another
      small drizzle of *olive oil* to the same skillet. Add the minced *garlic*
      and chopped *sun-dried tomatoes* and sautÃ© for 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
      Pour in the *chicken or vegetable stock* and *heavy cream*, bringing the
      mixture to a gentle simmer. Cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally,
      until the sauce slightly thickens.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Finish the sauce and combine: Stir in the *fresh spinach* until it wilts,
      which should take about 2-3 minutes. Add the grated *parmesan cheese* and
      stir until melted and smooth. Season the sauce with salt and black pepper
      to taste. Gently return the seared *salmon fillets* to the skillet,
      spooning some of the creamy Tuscan sauce over them.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Mash the potatoes: While the sauce simmers, return the drained *potatoes*
      to their pot over low heat for 1 minute to dry them out. Add the *unsalted
      butter* and *milk*. Mash until smooth and creamy. Season with salt and
      black pepper to taste.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Serve: Serve the creamy Tuscan salmon immediately alongside the buttery
      mashed potatoes. Garnish with *fresh parsley* if desired.
