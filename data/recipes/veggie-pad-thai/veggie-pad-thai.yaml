instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Prepare Tofu and Noodles: Press *extra-firm tofu* for at least 15 minutes to remove excess water, then cut into
      1.5 cm cubes. Soak *rice stick noodles* in warm water for 15-20 minutes until pliable but still firm (al dente);
      drain and set aside.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Make Pad Thai Sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together *tamarind paste*, *soy sauce*, *maple syrup*, and *rice
      vinegar*. Set aside.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Sauté *tofu* and Aromatics: Heat 1 tbsp of *vegetable oil* in a large wok or frying pan over medium-high heat. Add
      cubed tofu and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and slightly crispy on all sides, about 5-7
      minutes. Remove tofu from the pan and set aside. Add the remaining 1 tbsp of oil to the pan. Add minced *garlic*
      and sauté for 30 seconds until fragrant.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Stir-fry Vegetables: Add julienned *carrot*, thinly sliced *red bell pepper*, and small *broccoli florets* to the
      pan. Stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until vegetables are tender-crisp.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Combine and Finish Pad Thai: Add the soaked and drained rice *noodles* to the pan with the vegetables. Pour the
      prepared Pad Thai *sauce* over the noodles and vegetables. Toss everything together vigorously for 2-3 minutes
      until the noodles are well coated and heated through. Add the cooked *tofu*, *bean sprouts*, and sliced *spring
      onions*. Toss for another minute until bean sprouts are slightly wilted and all ingredients are combined.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Prepare *cucumber*-*lime* Ribbon Salad: While the Pad Thai is finishing, use a vegetable peeler to create long
      ribbons from the cucumber. In a small bowl, gently toss the cucumber ribbons with *lime juice* and a pinch of
      *salt*.
  - step: 7
    action: >-
      Serve: Divide the Veggie Pad Thai among serving plates. Garnish generously with *crushed roasted peanuts*, *fresh
      coriander*, and *lime* wedges. Serve immediately with the refreshing *cucumber*-lime ribbon salad on the side.
