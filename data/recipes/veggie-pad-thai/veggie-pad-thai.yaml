instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Prepare Tofu and Noodles: Press extra-firm tofu for at least 15 minutes to
      remove excess water, then cut into 1.5 cm cubes. Soak rice stick noodles
      in warm water for 15-20 minutes until pliable but still firm (al dente);
      drain and set aside.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Make Pad Thai Sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together tamarind paste, soy
      sauce, maple syrup, and rice vinegar. Set aside.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Sauté Tofu and Aromatics: Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large
      wok or frying pan over medium-high heat. Add cubed tofu and cook, stirring
      occasionally, until golden brown and slightly crispy on all sides, about
      5-7 minutes. Remove tofu from the pan and set aside. Add the remaining 1
      tablespoon of oil to the pan. Add minced garlic and sauté for 30 seconds
      until fragrant.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Stir-fry Vegetables: Add julienned carrot, thinly sliced red bell pepper,
      and small broccoli florets to the pan. Stir-fry for 3-4 minutes until
      vegetables are tender-crisp.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Combine and Finish Pad Thai: Add the soaked and drained rice noodles to
      the pan with the vegetables. Pour the prepared Pad Thai sauce over the
      noodles and vegetables. Toss everything together vigorously for 2-3
      minutes until the noodles are well coated and heated through. Add the
      cooked tofu, bean sprouts, and sliced spring onions. Toss for another
      minute until bean sprouts are slightly wilted and all ingredients are
      combined.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Prepare Cucumber-Lime Ribbon Salad: While the Pad Thai is finishing, use a
      vegetable peeler to create long ribbons from the cucumber. In a small
      bowl, gently toss the cucumber ribbons with lime juice and a pinch of
      salt.
  - step: 7
    action: >-
      Serve: Divide the Veggie Pad Thai among serving plates. Garnish generously
      with crushed roasted peanuts, fresh coriander, and lime wedges. Serve
      immediately with the refreshing cucumber-lime ribbon salad on the side.
