instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat oven to 180Â°C. Slice *chicken breasts* horizontally to create
      thinner cutlets. Drizzle with a little *olive oil*, then season generously
      with *garlic powder*, *salt*, and *black pepper*.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Line a baking tray with parchment paper. Spoon small mounds (approx. 1
      tbsp each) of *finely grated parmesan cheese* onto the tray, spacing them
      out. Bake for 8-10 minutes, or until golden and crispy. Let cool on the
      tray; they will crisp further.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Heat a grill pan or large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the seasoned
      *chicken cutlets* for 3-4 minutes per side, until cooked through and
      lightly charred. Remove from heat, let rest for a few minutes, then slice
      into strips. While chicken cooks, wash and chop the *romaine lettuce* into
      bite-sized pieces.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Lay out a *large flour tortilla*. Spread a generous amount of *Caesar
      dressing* down the center. Top with a portion of the sliced *grilled
      chicken* and chopped *romaine lettuce*. Add a sprinkle of any remaining
      *parmesan cheese*.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Fold in the sides of the *tortilla* and then tightly roll it up from the
      bottom. Slice the wrap in half diagonally if desired. Serve immediately
      with the baked *parmesan crisps* on the side.
