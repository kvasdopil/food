instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the *linguine* and cook
      according to package directions until al dente. Reserve 120 ml of the
      pasta cooking water before draining.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      While the pasta cooks, pat the *shrimp* dry with paper towels and season
      with salt and pepper. In a large pan or skillet, heat the *olive oil* over
      medium-high heat. Add the *shrimp* and cook for 1-2 minutes per side until
      pink and opaque. Remove the shrimp from the pan and set aside.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Reduce heat to medium. Add the *unsalted butter* to the same pan. Once
      melted, add the minced *garlic* and *red pepper flakes* (if using) and
      sautÃ© for about 1 minute until fragrant, being careful not to burn the
      garlic. Pour in the *dry white wine* (or broth) and scrape up any browned
      bits from the bottom of the pan. Let it simmer for 1-2 minutes until
      slightly reduced.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Stir in the zest and juice of the *lemon*. Return the cooked *shrimp* to
      the pan. Add the drained *linguine* and the reserved pasta cooking water.
      Toss everything together until the pasta is well coated and the sauce
      emulsifies slightly.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Remove from heat and stir in the finely chopped *fresh parsley*. Taste and
      adjust seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Serve the *shrimp* immediately, accompanied by the
      *mixed green salad* dressed with *vinaigrette*.
