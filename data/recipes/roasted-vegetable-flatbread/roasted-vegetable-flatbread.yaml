instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat oven to 200°C. If making balsamic glaze, pour *balsamic vinegar*
      into a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-low heat. Cook for
      5-10 minutes, or until reduced by half and slightly thickened. Set aside
      to cool.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      On a large baking tray, combine the chopped *red bell pepper*, *yellow
      bell pepper*, *zucchini*, *red onion*, and *cherry tomatoes*. Drizzle
      generously with olive oil, season with salt and black pepper, and toss to
      coat evenly. Roast for 15-20 minutes, or until vegetables are tender and
      slightly charred.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      While the vegetables roast, prepare the olive tapenade. In a small bowl,
      combine the *mixed olives*, *capers*, *garlic clove*, and a squeeze of
      fresh *lemon* juice. Drizzle with 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil and mix
      well. Set aside.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Once vegetables are roasted, remove them from the oven. Increase oven
      temperature to 220°C (if needed, depending on how quickly your oven heats
      up).
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Place the *flatbreads* directly on the oven rack or on a clean baking
      tray. Distribute the roasted vegetables evenly over each flatbread, then
      crumble the *goat cheese* over the top. Bake for 5-7 minutes, or until the
      flatbread is crisp and the goat cheese is warmed through and slightly
      softened.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Carefully remove the flatbreads from the oven. Drizzle with the prepared
      balsamic glaze. Serve immediately with a generous side of the mixed olive
      tapenade.
