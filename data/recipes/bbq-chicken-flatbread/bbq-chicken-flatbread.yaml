instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat your oven to 200Â°C. If using *flatbreads* that require pre-baking,
      follow package instructions briefly to crisp them up before topping,
      otherwise, proceed to the next step.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Prepare the corn salad: In a medium bowl, combine the *sweet corn*, diced
      *red bell pepper*, half of the thinly sliced *red onion*, and half of the
      chopped *cilantro*. Drizzle with *olive oil*, add the juice from the
      *lime*, and season with a pinch of *salt* and *black pepper*. Toss to
      combine and set aside.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Assemble the flatbreads: Spread an even layer of *bbq sauce* over each
      *flatbread*. Distribute the shredded *cooked chicken* evenly over the
      sauce. Sprinkle with shredded *mozzarella cheese* and the remaining thinly
      sliced *red onion*.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Bake the flatbreads for 8-12 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and
      bubbly and the edges of the *flatbreads* are golden brown. Keep an eye on
      them to prevent burning.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Carefully remove the flatbreads from the oven. Garnish with the remaining
      fresh *cilantro*. Slice each flatbread into desired portions and serve
      immediately alongside the sweet corn salad.
