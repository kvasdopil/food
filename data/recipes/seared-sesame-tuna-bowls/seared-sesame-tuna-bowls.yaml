instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Rinse *brown rice* thoroughly. Combine with 300ml water in a small
      saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 30-40
      minutes until water is absorbed and rice is tender. Let stand, covered,
      for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Thinly slice *radishes* and *cucumber*. In a medium bowl, whisk together
      30ml *rice vinegar*, 10ml *maple syrup*, and 5ml grated *fresh ginger*.
      Add the sliced radishes and cucumber, toss to combine, and set aside to
      marinate.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      In a small bowl, whisk together 30ml *soy sauce*, 30ml *rice vinegar*,
      15ml *sesame oil*, 5ml *maple syrup*, and the remaining 10ml grated *fresh
      ginger*. Set aside.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Pat *tuna steaks* dry with paper towels. Press both sides of each tuna
      steak firmly into the *sesame seeds* to create a crust. Heat a drizzle of
      oil in a non-stick pan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Sear the
      tuna for 1-2 minutes per side for rare, or 3-4 minutes per side for
      medium, depending on thickness. Remove from pan and slice against the
      grain into 1 cm thick pieces.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Divide the cooked *brown rice* between two bowls. Top with sliced *seared
      tuna*, sliced *avocado*, and the *pickled radish salad*. Drizzle
      generously with the *ginger soy drizzle*. Serve immediately.
