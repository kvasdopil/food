instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Wash and cut *potatoes* into small sticks (approximately 1 cm x 1 cm x 4
      cm) or 1 cm cubes. Dice *pancetta*. Slice *cremini mushrooms*. Mince
      *garlic*. Chop *fresh parsley*.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Heat a large frying pan over medium heat. Add diced *pancetta* and cook
      until crispy and most of the fat has rendered, about 5-7 minutes. Remove
      the cooked pancetta with a slotted spoon and set aside, leaving the
      rendered fat in the pan.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Add a drizzle of *olive oil* to the pan with the pancetta fat if needed.
      Add the cut *potatoes* to the pan in a single layer if possible. Cook over
      medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until golden brown and tender,
      about 15-20 minutes. If they start to crisp too much, reduce heat and add
      a splash of water, then cover for a few minutes to steam and soften, then
      uncover to continue browning. Season with a pinch of *salt* and *black
      pepper*.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Add the sliced *cremini mushrooms* to the pan with the potatoes. Cook,
      stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms are softened and have released
      their liquid, about 5-7 minutes. Add the minced *garlic* and cook for
      another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Return the cooked *pancetta* to the pan with the potatoes and mushrooms.
      Stir to combine and heat through for 1-2 minutes. Taste and adjust
      seasoning with more *salt* and *pepper* if needed.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Transfer the fried potatoes to serving plates. Garnish generously with
      chopped *fresh parsley*. For the side salad, combine *mixed green salad*
      with *balsamic vinegar* and *extra virgin olive oil*, then season with a
      pinch of *salt* and *pepper*. Serve immediately with the salad.
