instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Gently lower the *large eggs* into
      the boiling water and cook for 6-7 minutes for a jammy yolk. Immediately
      transfer eggs to an ice bath to stop cooking, then peel and halve. Slice
      the *pork tenderloin* into thin rounds. Mince the *garlic* and grate the
      *fresh ginger*. Thinly slice the *green onions*.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Heat 5 ml of *sesame oil* in a large pot or deep pan over medium-high heat.
      Add the *pork tenderloin* slices and sear for 2-3 minutes per side until
      lightly browned and cooked through. Remove the pork from the pot and set
      aside.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      In the same pot, add the remaining 10 ml of *sesame oil*. Add the *minced
      garlic* and *grated fresh ginger*, and sautÃ© for 1 minute until fragrant.
      Pour in the *chicken stock*, *soy sauce*, and *mirin*. Bring the broth to
      a simmer and let it cook gently for 5-7 minutes to allow the flavors to
      meld. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      While the broth simmers, bring a separate pot of water to a boil. Cook the
      *ramen noodles* according to package instructions until al dente. Drain
      well. In the same boiling water, quickly blanch the *baby spinach* for 30
      seconds until wilted. Drain and squeeze out excess water. Toss the
      blanched spinach with a drizzle of *sesame oil* and a pinch of *toasted
      sesame seeds*.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Divide the cooked ramen noodles among two serving bowls. Ladle the hot
      broth over the noodles. Arrange the *seared pork*, *halved soft eggs*, and
      *sesame spinach* on top. Garnish with *sliced green onions* and additional
      *toasted sesame seeds*. Serve immediately.
