instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat oven to 200°C. Slice *zucchini* and toss with a drizzle of olive
      oil, a pinch of salt, and a pinch of black pepper. Spread on a baking
      tray.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Place the tray with *zucchini* in the preheated oven and roast for 20-25
      minutes, or until tender and slightly browned. While *zucchini* roasts,
      pat *catfish fillets* dry with paper towels. Sprinkle 1 tbsp of *cajun
      seasoning* evenly over both sides of each *catfish fillet*.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      In a medium bowl, combine *sweet corn*, finely diced *red onion*, halved
      *cherry tomatoes*, chopped *coriander*, and finely diced *jalapeño* (if
      using). Squeeze the juice of *lime* over the mixture. Add a pinch of salt
      and black pepper, then stir to combine. Set aside.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Heat a large non-stick pan over medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive
      oil. Once hot, carefully place the seasoned *catfish fillets* in the pan.
      Cook for 3-5 minutes per side, or until the *catfish* is opaque and flakes
      easily with a fork. Adjust heat if the seasoning starts to burn too
      quickly.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Divide the roasted *zucchini* among plates. Top each *catfish fillet* with
      a generous spoonful of *corn salsa*. Serve immediately.
