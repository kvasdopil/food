instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat oven to 200°C. In a large bowl, toss the *baby potatoes* with a
      drizzle of *olive oil*, *dried rosemary*, a pinch of *salt*, and *black pepper*.
      Spread them in a single layer on a baking tray. Roast for 20-25 minutes,
      or until tender and lightly browned.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      While potatoes roast, pat the *sirloin steak* cubes dry with paper towels
      and season generously with *salt* and *black pepper*. Trim the ends of the
      *fresh green beans*.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Heat 1 tbsp of *olive oil* in a large heavy-bottomed pan or cast-iron
      skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the *sirloin steak*
      cubes in a single layer, working in batches if necessary to avoid
      overcrowding, and sear for 2-3 minutes per side until nicely browned.
      Remove the seared steak to a plate.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Reduce heat to medium. Add the *unsalted butter* to the same pan and let
      it melt. Add the minced *garlic* and cook for about 30 seconds until
      fragrant, being careful not to burn it. Return the seared *sirloin steak*
      to the pan and toss to coat evenly in the garlic butter.
  - step: 5

      While the steak is finishing, steam or quickly sauté the *fresh green
      beans* for 5-7 minutes until tender-crisp.

    action: >-
      Serve the garlic butter steak bites immediately alongside the roasted
      *baby potatoes* and steamed *fresh green beans*. Garnish with fresh
      chopped *fresh parsley*.
