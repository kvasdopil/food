instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat your oven to 200Â°C. In a large bowl, toss the halved baby potatoes
      with 30 millilitres of olive oil, minced garlic, dried oregano, salt, and
      black pepper until evenly coated. Spread the seasoned potatoes in a single
      layer on a large baking tray.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Roast the potatoes in the preheated oven for 15 minutes to give them a
      head start.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      While the potatoes are roasting, prepare the portobello mushrooms. Brush
      the mushroom caps with the remaining 30 millilitres of olive oil and
      season lightly with salt and pepper. Slice the cherry tomatoes and fresh
      mozzarella.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      After 15 minutes, carefully remove the baking tray from the oven. Arrange
      the prepared portobello mushroom caps, gill-side up, on the same tray
      alongside the potatoes (or use a second tray if needed). Fill each
      mushroom cap generously with the sliced mozzarella and halved cherry
      tomatoes.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Return the tray(s) to the oven and continue to roast for another 15-20
      minutes, or until the mushrooms are tender, the cheese is melted and
      bubbly, and the potatoes are golden brown and cooked through.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Remove from the oven. Drizzle the Caprese stuffed portobellos with
      balsamic glaze. Garnish with fresh basil leaves if desired. Serve
      immediately with the herb-roasted baby potatoes.
