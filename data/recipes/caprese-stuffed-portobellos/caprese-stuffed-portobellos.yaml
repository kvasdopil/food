    action: >-
      Preheat your oven to 200Â°C. In a large bowl, toss the halved *baby potatoes* with 30 ml of *olive oil*, minced
      *garlic*, *dried oregano*, *salt*, and *black pepper* until evenly coated. Spread the seasoned potatoes in a
      single layer on a large baking tray.
  - step: 2
    action: Roast the *potatoes* in the preheated oven for 15 minutes to give them a head start.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      While the *potatoes* are roasting, prepare the *portobello mushrooms*. Brush the mushroom caps with the remaining
      30 ml of *olive oil* and season lightly with *salt* and *pepper*. Slice the *cherry tomatoes* and *fresh
      mozzarella*.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      After 15 minutes, carefully remove the baking tray from the oven. Arrange the prepared *portobello mushroom* caps,
      gill-side up, on the same tray alongside the *potatoes* (or use a second tray if needed). Fill each mushroom cap
      generously with the sliced *mozzarella* and halved *cherry tomatoes*.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Return the tray(s) to the oven and continue to roast for another 15-20 minutes, or until the *mushrooms* are
      tender, the cheese is melted and bubbly, and the *potatoes* are golden brown and cooked through.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Remove from the oven. Drizzle the Caprese stuffed portobellos with *balsamic glaze*. Garnish with *fresh basil*
      leaves if desired. Serve immediately with the herb-roasted *baby potatoes*.
