      1/2 tsp of *salt*, and 1/4 tsp of *black pepper*. Roast for 15 minutes.
  - step: 2

      While the *potatoes* roast, prepare the *lemon*-*garlic* *unsalted butter*. In a small bowl, combine the melted
      *unsalted butter*, minced *garlic*, the juice from half a *lemon*, and half of the chopped *fresh parsley*. Season
      with a pinch of *salt* and *black pepper*.

      After 15 minutes, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Push the roasted *potatoes* to one side of the sheet. Add

      *salt*, and 1/8 tsp of *black pepper*.
  - step: 4

      Place the *salmon fillets*, skin-side down if applicable, on the baking sheet among the vegetables. Spoon the

      slice.

      Return the baking sheet to the oven and bake for another 12-18 minutes, or until the salmon is cooked through and
