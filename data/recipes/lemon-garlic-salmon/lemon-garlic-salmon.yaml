instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). On a large baking sheet, toss the
      halved baby potatoes with 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon of salt,
      and 1/4 teaspoon of black pepper. Roast for 15 minutes.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      While the potatoes roast, prepare the lemon-garlic butter. In a small
      bowl, combine the melted butter, minced garlic, the juice from half a
      lemon, and half of the chopped fresh parsley. Season with a pinch of salt
      and pepper.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      After 15 minutes, remove the baking sheet from the oven. Push the roasted
      potatoes to one side of the sheet. Add the trimmed green beans to the
      empty side, tossing them with the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 1/4
      teaspoon of salt, and 1/8 teaspoon of black pepper.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Place the salmon fillets, skin-side down if applicable, on the baking
      sheet among the vegetables. Spoon the lemon-garlic butter mixture evenly
      over each salmon fillet. Top each fillet with a thin lemon slice.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Return the baking sheet to the oven and bake for another 12-18 minutes, or
      until the salmon is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork, and the
      vegetables are tender-crisp. Cooking time will vary based on salmon
      thickness.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Garnish the entire dish with the remaining fresh parsley before serving
      immediately.
