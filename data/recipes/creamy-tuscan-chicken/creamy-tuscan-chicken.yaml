instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Prepare the chicken: Pat the *chicken breasts* dry and season generously
      with salt and black pepper. Heat 1 tbsp of *olive oil* in a large pan or
      skillet over medium-high heat.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Sear the chicken: Once the oil is shimmering, add the seasoned *chicken
      breasts* to the pan. Sear for 3-4 minutes per side, until golden brown and
      cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside on a plate,
      loosely covered.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Start the polenta: While the chicken cooks, bring 750 ml of water to a
      boil in a medium saucepan. Add a pinch of salt. Slowly whisk in the
      *quick-cooking polenta*, ensuring no lumps form. Reduce heat to low and
      simmer, stirring frequently, for 5-7 minutes until thickened. Stir in 15 g
      of *butter* and half of the *Parmesan cheese*.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Build the sauce: In the same pan used for the chicken, melt the remaining
      15 g of *butter* over medium heat. Add the minced *garlic* and *dried
      Italian seasoning*, and sautÃ© for 1 minute until fragrant. Stir in the
      sliced *sun-dried tomatoes*.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Finish the sauce: Pour in the *chicken broth* and bring to a gentle
      simmer, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Stir in
      the *heavy cream* and bring back to a simmer. Add the *fresh spinach* and
      cook until wilted, about 2-3 minutes. Season the sauce with salt and
      pepper to taste.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Combine and serve: Return the cooked *chicken breasts* to the pan with the
      sauce, spooning the sauce over the chicken to coat. Stir the *fresh
      parsley* into the prepared *polenta*. Serve the creamy tuscan chicken
      immediately alongside the herbed polenta, garnished with the remaining
      *Parmesan cheese*.
