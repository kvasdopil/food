instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Finely chop the *yellow onion* and mince the *garlic cloves*. Roughly chop
      the *fresh basil*, reserving a few leaves for garnish.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Heat a drizzle of *olive oil* in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium
      heat. Add the chopped *yellow onion* and cook until softened and
      translucent, about 5-7 minutes. Add the minced *garlic cloves* and cook
      for another minute until fragrant. Pour in the *canned crushed tomatoes*
      and *vegetable broth*. Stir in the *granulated sugar* (if using), a pinch
      of *salt*, and a grind of *black pepper*. Bring to a simmer, then reduce
      heat to low, cover, and cook for 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to
      meld.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      While the soup simmers, prepare the grilled cheese croutons. Butter one
      side of each *slice of white or sourdough bread* with *unsalted butter*.
      Place the *slices of cheddar or american cheese* between two slices of
      bread, buttered sides out. Heat a large pan over medium heat and cook the
      sandwiches for 3-4 minutes per side, until golden brown and the cheese is
      melted and bubbly. Remove from heat and let cool slightly.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Carefully transfer the hot soup to a blender (or use an immersion blender
      directly in the pot) and blend until completely smooth and silky. Return
      the soup to the pot if using a standard blender. Stir in the *heavy cream*
      and most of the chopped *fresh basil*. Taste and adjust *salt* and *black
      pepper* as needed.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Cut the cooled grilled cheese sandwiches into small, bite-sized cubes to
      create the *grilled cheese croutons*.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Ladle the hot soup into bowls. Top each serving generously with the
      *grilled cheese croutons*. Garnish with the reserved *fresh basil* leaves.
      Serve immediately with a side of *mixed greens*.
