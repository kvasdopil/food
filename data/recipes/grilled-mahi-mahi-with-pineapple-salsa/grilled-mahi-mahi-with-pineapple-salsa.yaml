instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Prepare the Pineapple Salsa and start the Coconut Rice: In a medium bowl,
      combine the finely diced *fresh pineapple*, *red onion*, *jalapeño*, and
      chopped *fresh cilantro*. Squeeze the juice from one *lime* over the
      mixture, add a pinch of salt and pepper, and stir to combine. Set aside.
      For the rice, rinse the *basmati rice* under cold water until the water
      runs clear. In a medium saucepan, combine the rinsed *basmati rice*,
      *coconut milk*, 200ml of water, and 1/2 tsp of salt. Bring to a boil, then
      reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-18 minutes, or until all
      liquid is absorbed.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Season the Mahi Mahi and prepare the Black Beans: While the rice cooks,
      pat the *mahi mahi fillets* dry with paper towels. Drizzle lightly with
      olive oil, then season generously on both sides with *smoked paprika*,
      salt, and black pepper. In a small saucepan, heat a drizzle of olive oil
      over medium heat. Add the minced *garlic* and sauté for 30 seconds until
      fragrant. Add the rinsed and drained *canned black beans*, *ground cumin*,
      a pinch of salt, pepper, and a splash of water (about 50ml). Bring to a
      gentle simmer and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until
      heated through.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Grill the Mahi Mahi: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat (approx.
      200°C). Lightly oil the grill grates. Place the seasoned *mahi mahi
      fillets* on the hot grill. Grill for 3-5 minutes per side, depending on
      thickness, until the fish is opaque and flakes easily with a fork.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Finish and Serve: Once the *coconut rice* is cooked, remove it from heat
      and let it sit, covered, for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork. Taste the
      *pineapple salsa* and *black beans*, adjusting seasoning (more *lime
      juice* for the salsa, salt/pepper for the beans) if needed. Serve the
      grilled *mahi mahi* fillets immediately, topped generously with the
      vibrant *pineapple salsa*. Accompany with portions of creamy *coconut
      rice* and savory *black beans*.
