instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Prepare Pickled Vegetables: Thinly slice the *medium carrot* and half of
      the *medium cucumber*. In a small bowl, combine the *white vinegar*, 120
      ml water, *sugar*, and a pinch of *salt*. Add the sliced carrot and cucumber,
      stirring to combine. Let them sit while you prepare the rest of the meal.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Prepare Bulgur for Tabbouleh: Place the *fine bulgur wheat* in a small
      heatproof bowl. Pour over 120 ml boiling water, cover the bowl tightly,
      and let it sit for 10-15 minutes until the bulgur is softened and the
      water is absorbed. Fluff with a fork.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Make Falafel Mixture: Drain and rinse the *canned chickpeas*. In a food
      processor, combine the chickpeas, 30 g of the *fresh parsley*, all of the
      *fresh coriander*, the *small onion*, *garlic cloves*, *plain flour*,
      *baking powder*, *ground cumin*, *ground coriander*, a pinch of *salt*, and
      a grind of *black pepper*. Pulse until the mixture is well combined but
      still has a slightly coarse texture. Form the mixture into 12-15 small
      patties or balls.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Prepare Tabbouleh: While the bulgur softens, finely dice the remaining
      *medium cucumber* and *medium tomatoes*. Finely chop the *fresh mint* and
      the remaining 15 g of *fresh parsley*. Once the bulgur is ready, combine
      it in a bowl with the diced vegetables, chopped mint, chopped parsley,
      juice of half a *lemon*, and *olive oil*. Season with *salt* and *black pepper* to
      taste, mixing well.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Fry Falafel: Heat the *vegetable oil* in a deep pan or pot over
      medium-high heat until it reaches 170-180°C. Carefully fry the falafel
      patties in batches for 3-5 minutes per side, until they are golden brown
      and cooked through. Remove the falafel with a slotted spoon and drain on
      paper towels to remove excess oil.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Assemble Mezze Plates: Warm the *pita breads* in a dry pan or in an oven
      preheated to 180°C for 1-2 minutes until they are soft and pliable.
      Arrange the falafel, *prepared hummus*, tabbouleh, and the drained
      pickled vegetables on individual plates. Serve immediately with the
      pita breads and lemon wedges for squeezing. A drizzle of *olive oil*
      and a few *fresh mint* leaves can be added as a garnish if desired.
