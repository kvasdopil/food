instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Cook the rice: Rinse white rice thoroughly. Combine rice and 4 cups of
      water in a medium saucepan. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low,
      cover, and simmer for 15-18 minutes, or until all water is absorbed.
      Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes before fluffing
      with a fork.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Prepare teriyaki sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together soy sauce, mirin,
      brown sugar, minced garlic, and grated ginger. Set aside 2 tablespoons of
      this mixture in a separate small bowl for later.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Cook chicken: Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over
      medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces and cook for 5-7 minutes,
      stirring occasionally, until browned on all sides and cooked through.
      Remove chicken from the skillet and set aside.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Steam vegetables: While the chicken cooks, steam the broccoli florets and
      sliced carrots in a steamer basket over boiling water for 5-7 minutes, or
      until perfectly tender-crisp. Alternatively, microwave with a splash of
      water until desired tenderness.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Create the glossy glaze: Pour the main teriyaki sauce mixture (from Step
      2) into the skillet. Bring to a simmer over medium heat. In the small bowl
      with the reserved teriyaki mixture, whisk in the cornstarch until smooth.
      Pour this cornstarch slurry into the simmering sauce, whisking constantly.
      Cook for 1-2 minutes, until the sauce thickens into a warm glossy glaze.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Combine and serve: Return the cooked chicken to the skillet with the
      thickened teriyaki glaze and toss to coat thoroughly. To assemble the
      bowls, divide the cooked rice among serving bowls. Top with the warm,
      glazed teriyaki chicken and the perfectly steamed broccoli and carrots.
      Garnish with sliced green onions and sesame seeds. Serve immediately,
      optionally alongside a quick instant miso soup.
