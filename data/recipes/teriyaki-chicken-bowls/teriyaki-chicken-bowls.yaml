instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Cook the rice: Rinse *white rice* thoroughly. Combine rice and 960 ml of *water* in a medium saucepan. Bring to a
      boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-18 minutes, or until all water is absorbed. Remove from
      heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes before fluffing with a fork.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Prepare teriyaki sauce: In a medium bowl, whisk together *soy sauce*, *mirin*, *brown sugar*, minced *garlic*, and
      grated *ginger*. Set aside 2 tbsp of this mixture in a separate small bowl for later.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Cook chicken: Heat *vegetable oil* in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces and
      cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until browned on all sides and cooked through. Remove chicken from
      the skillet and set aside.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Steam vegetables: While the chicken cooks, steam the *broccoli* florets and sliced *carrots* in a steamer basket
      over boiling *water* for 5-7 minutes, or until perfectly tender-crisp. Alternatively, microwave with a splash of
      water until desired tenderness.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Create the glossy glaze: Pour the main teriyaki mixture (from Step 2) into the skillet. Bring to a simmer
      over medium heat. In the small bowl with the reserved teriyaki mixture, whisk in the *cornstarch* until smooth.
      Pour this cornstarch slurry into the simmering sauce, whisking constantly. Cook for 1-2 minutes, until the sauce
      thickens into a warm glossy glaze.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Combine and serve: Return the cooked chicken to the skillet with the thickened teriyaki glaze and toss to coat
      thoroughly. To assemble the bowls, divide the cooked *rice* among serving bowls. Top with the warm, glazed
      teriyaki chicken and the perfectly steamed *broccoli* and *carrots*. Garnish with sliced *green onions* and
      *sesame seeds*. Serve immediately, optionally alongside a quick instant miso soup.
