instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Prepare the *chicken breast* by cutting it into 2 cm strips. Season
      generously with salt and black pepper. Cut the *broccoli* into bite-sized
      florets.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add the *penne pasta*
      and cook according to package directions until al dente, usually 10-12
      minutes. Before draining, reserve about 120 ml of the pasta cooking water.
      Drain the pasta and set aside.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      While the pasta cooks, heat a drizzle of *olive oil* in a large skillet or
      pan over medium-high heat. Add the seasoned *chicken breast* strips and
      cook for 5-7 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through. Remove the
      chicken from the pan and set aside, leaving any drippings in the pan.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Reduce heat to medium. Add the *unsalted butter* to the same skillet. Once
      melted, add the minced *garlic* and *dried oregano*, and sautÃ© for 1
      minute until fragrant, being careful not to burn the garlic.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Pour in the *chicken broth* and *heavy cream*. Bring to a gentle simmer,
      stirring occasionally, and cook for 3-4 minutes until the sauce slightly
      thickens. Stir in the *Parmesan cheese* until melted and smooth. If the
      sauce is too thick, add a splash of the reserved pasta water until desired
      consistency is reached. Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Return the cooked *chicken breast* to the skillet with the sauce. Add the
      drained *penne pasta* and toss to coat everything evenly. Keep warm.
  - step: 7
    action: >-
      While the sauce simmers, steam the *broccoli florets*. You can use a
      steamer basket over the boiling pasta water (if available and timed well)
      or a separate pot with a small amount of water. Steam for 5-7 minutes
      until tender-crisp.
  - step: 8
    action: >-
      Serve the *garlic parmesan chicken pasta* immediately, garnished with
      fresh *parsley* if desired, alongside the steamed *broccoli*.
