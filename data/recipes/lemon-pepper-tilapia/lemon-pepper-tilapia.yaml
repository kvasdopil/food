instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Rinse *quinoa* thoroughly under cold water. In a small saucepan, combine
      the rinsed *quinoa* with *300ml vegetable broth or water* and a pinch of
      *salt*. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15
      minutes, or until all liquid is absorbed. Remove from heat and let stand,
      covered, for 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      While the quinoa cooks, pat *tilapia fillets* dry with paper towels.
      Season both sides of the *tilapia fillets* with *salt* and 1 tsp of *black
      pepper*. Zest half of the *lemon* over the fillets.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Heat 1 tbsp *olive oil* in a large pan or skillet over medium-high heat.
      Add *green beans* and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally,
      until tender-crisp. Add *garlic* and cook for another minute until
      fragrant. Season with a pinch of *salt* and *black pepper*. Remove from pan and
      set aside.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      In the same pan, add the remaining 1 tbsp *olive oil* and heat over
      medium-high heat. Once hot, carefully place the seasoned *tilapia fillets*
      in the pan. Sear for 3-4 minutes per side, or until golden brown and
      cooked through (it should flake easily with a fork).
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Remove *tilapia fillets* from heat. Squeeze juice from the remaining *lemon* half
      over the cooked *tilapia fillets*. Sprinkle with the remaining 1 tsp of *black
      pepper* and a final drizzle of *lemon* zest.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
