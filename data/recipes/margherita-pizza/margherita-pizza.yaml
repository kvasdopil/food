instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat your oven to its highest setting, ideally around 250Â°C, with a pizza stone or baking steel inside if you
      have one. If not, a regular baking tray will work.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Prepare the tomato sauce: In a small bowl, combine the *crushed tomatoes*, minced *garlic*, 15 ml of *olive oil*,
      and a pinch of *salt*. Stir well and set aside.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Lightly dust a work surface with *flour* and gently stretch the *pizza dough* or use parchment paper to your
      desired thickness, aiming for a round shape about 25-30 cm in diameter.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Carefully transfer the pizza dough to the hot pizza stone or baking tray. Spread the tomato sauce evenly over
      the dough, leaving a small border for the crust. Distribute the sliced *mozzarella* over the sauce.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Bake for 8-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and blistered, and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
      Cooking time may vary depending on your oven.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      While the pizza bakes, prepare the *arugula* salad: In a medium bowl, combine the arugula. In a separate small
      bowl, whisk together the juice of half a *lemon*, the remaining 15 ml of olive oil, a pinch of salt, and a dash of
      black pepper to create a simple vinaigrette.
  - step: 7
    action: >-
      Once the pizza is out of the oven, immediately scatter the *fresh basil leaves* over the hot cheese. Slice and
      serve hot with the dressed arugula salad on the side.
