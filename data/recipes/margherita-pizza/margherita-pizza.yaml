instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat your oven to its highest setting, ideally around 250Â°C, with a
      pizza stone or baking steel inside if you have one. If not, a regular
      baking tray will work.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Prepare the tomato sauce: In a small bowl, combine the crushed tomatoes,
      minced garlic, 15 millilitres of olive oil, and a pinch of salt. Stir well
      and set aside.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Gently stretch the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface or a piece of
      parchment paper to your desired thickness, aiming for a round shape about
      25-30 cm in diameter.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Carefully transfer the dough to the hot pizza stone or baking tray. Spread
      the tomato sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border for the
      crust. Distribute the sliced mozzarella over the sauce.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Bake for 8-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and blistered,
      and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Cooking time may vary depending on
      your oven.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      While the pizza bakes, prepare the arugula salad: In a medium bowl,
      combine the arugula. In a separate small bowl, whisk together the juice of
      half a lemon, the remaining 15 millilitres of olive oil, a pinch of salt,
      and a dash of black pepper to create a simple vinaigrette.
  - step: 7
    action: >-
      Once the pizza is out of the oven, immediately scatter the fresh basil
      leaves over the hot cheese. Drizzle with a little extra virgin olive oil
      if desired. Slice and serve hot with the dressed arugula salad on the
      side.
