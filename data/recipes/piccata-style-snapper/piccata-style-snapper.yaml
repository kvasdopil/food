instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat oven to 200Â°C. Place *baby potatoes* in a saucepan, cover with
      cold salted water, bring to a boil, and cook for 15-20 minutes until
      tender. Drain well.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      While potatoes cook, pat *snapper fillets* dry with paper towel. Season
      both sides with salt and pepper. Place *plain flour* on a shallow plate
      and dredge each fillet, shaking off excess.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Transfer cooked potatoes to a baking tray. Using a fork or potato masher,
      gently smash each potato until flattened. Drizzle generously with olive
      oil, season with salt and pepper, and roast in the preheated oven for
      15-20 minutes until golden and crispy.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Heat a large frying pan over medium-high heat with a drizzle of olive oil.
      Cook *snapper fillets* skin-side down (if applicable) for 3-4 minutes
      until crispy, then flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes until cooked
      through. Remove snapper from pan and set aside on a plate.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Reduce heat to medium. Add *garlic* to the pan and cook for 30 seconds
      until fragrant. Pour in *chicken or vegetable stock* and the juice of one
      *lemon*, scraping up any browned bits. Stir in *capers* and *unsalted
      butter* until the butter is melted and the sauce slightly thickens. Season
      with salt and pepper to taste.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Return the cooked snapper to the pan, spooning the sauce over the fillets.
      Garnish with *fresh parsley* and serve immediately alongside the crispy
      smashed baby potatoes.
