instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Prepare the sushi rice: Wash *sushi rice* under cold water until the water
      runs clear. Cook the *sushi rice* with *water* in a rice cooker or a pot
      according to package directions. While the rice is hot, combine *rice
      vinegar*, *sugar*, and *salt* in a small bowl and stir until dissolved.
      Gently fold this seasoning mixture into the cooked *sushi rice* and let it
      cool slightly.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Prepare the spicy tuna: In a medium bowl, combine *mayonnaise*,
      *sriracha*, *sesame oil*, and *soy sauce*. Add the diced *ahi tuna* to the
      bowl and gently toss to coat all the pieces evenly with the spicy
      mayonnaise mixture.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Prepare vegetables: Dice the *cucumber* into small, uniform cubes. Halve,
      pit, peel, and then slice the *avocado*. Using kitchen scissors, cut the
      *nori* sheet into thin, delicate strips for garnish.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Assemble the bowls: Divide the seasoned *sushi rice* evenly between two
      serving bowls. Arrange the prepared *spicy tuna* mixture on top of the
      rice in the center of each bowl. Artfully place the diced *cucumber*,
      sliced *avocado*, and a portion of the *seaweed salad* around the tuna.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Garnish and serve: Finish each bowl by sprinkling with *sesame seeds* and
      the *nori* strips. Serve your spicy tuna poke bowls immediately for the
      best flavor and texture.
