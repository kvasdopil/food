instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown the ground beef (and
      chopped onion, if using). If the beef is not lean, you may add a
      tablespoon of vegetable oil to prevent sticking. Cook, breaking up the
      meat with a spoon, until no pink remains, about 5-7 minutes.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Drain any excess fat from the skillet. Stir in the taco seasoning mix and
      water. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce heat to low and cook for
      5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has mostly absorbed
      and the beef is well-seasoned.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      While the beef is simmering, prepare your toppings. Shred the lettuce and
      cheddar cheese, if not already pre-shredded. Set aside.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C) or follow package directions to warm
      the taco shells. Place the taco shells on a baking sheet and bake for 5-7
      minutes, or until lightly crispy and warm. Alternatively, microwave them
      for 30-45 seconds until warm.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Assemble the tacos by spooning the seasoned ground beef into each warm
      taco shell. Top with shredded lettuce and shredded cheddar cheese. Serve
      immediately, optionally alongside quick Mexican rice.
