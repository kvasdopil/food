instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      In a large skillet over medium-high heat, brown the *ground beef* (and chopped *yellow onion*, if using). If the beef is
      not lean, you may add a tbsp of *vegetable oil* to prevent sticking. Cook, breaking up the meat with a spoon,
      until no pink remains, about 5-7 minutes.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Drain any excess fat from the skillet. Stir in the *taco seasoning mix* and *water*. Bring the mixture to a
      simmer, then reduce heat to low and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the liquid has mostly
      absorbed and the *ground beef* is well-seasoned.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      While the *ground beef* is simmering, prepare your toppings. Shred the *iceberg or romaine lettuce* and *cheddar cheese*, if not already
      pre-shredded. Set aside.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Preheat your oven to 160Â°C or follow package directions to warm the *crispy corn taco shells*. Place the taco shells on a
      baking sheet and bake for 5-7 minutes, or until lightly crispy and warm. Alternatively, microwave them for 30-45
      seconds until warm.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Assemble the tacos by spooning the seasoned *ground beef* into each warm *crispy corn taco shell*. Top with
      shredded *iceberg or romaine lettuce* and shredded *cheddar cheese*. Serve immediately.
