instructions:

    action: >-
      Prepare your ingredients: If using *frozen peas*, thaw them. Mince the
      *garlic* and grate the *fresh ginger*. Whisk the *large eggs* in a small
      bowl with a pinch of *salt* and *black pepper*. If your *raw shrimp* are not
      already peeled and deveined, prepare them now.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Heat 1 tbsp of *neutral cooking oil* in a large wok or skillet over
      medium-high heat. Add the *raw shrimp* and cook for 2-3 minutes until pink
      and opaque. Remove the cooked *shrimp* from the wok and set aside.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Add the remaining 1 tbsp of *neutral cooking oil* to the wok. Pour in the
      whisked *large eggs* and scramble them, breaking them into small pieces as
      they cook. Once cooked, remove the *eggs* from the wok and set aside with
      the *shrimp*.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Reduce heat to medium. Add the minced *garlic* and grated *fresh ginger*
      to the wok and stir-fry for about 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the
      *cooked rice* to the wok, breaking up any clumps with your spatula.
      Stir-fry for 3-4 minutes, allowing the rice to heat through and slightly
      crisp.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Add the thawed *frozen peas*, cooked *raw shrimp*, and scrambled *large
      eggs* back into the wok. Pour the *soy sauce* over everything and add 1 tsp of *sesame oil*. Toss vigorously to combine all ingredients and ensure
      the rice is evenly coated with the *soy sauce*. Cook for another 2-3
      minutes until everything is hot.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      While the fried rice is cooking, prepare the *frozen edamame*: steam or
      boil according to package directions. Serve the shrimp fried rice
      immediately, garnished with the steamed frozen edamame on the side.
