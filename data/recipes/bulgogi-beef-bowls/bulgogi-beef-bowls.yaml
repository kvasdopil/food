instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      In a large bowl, combine 60ml *soy sauce*, 30g *brown sugar*, 15ml *sesame
      oil*, 3 cloves minced *garlic*, 15g grated *fresh ginger*, 1/2 medium
      grated *yellow onion*, and 1/2 medium grated *Asian pear* (if using). Add
      500g thinly sliced *beef sirloin or flank steak* to the marinade, ensuring
      it's well coated. Let it marinate at room temperature for at least 15
      minutes while you prepare other components, or refrigerate for up to 30
      minutes.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Rinse 300g *short-grain white rice* under cold water until the water runs
      clear. Cook the rice according to package directions, typically in a
      saucepan with a 1:1.25 ratio of rice to water, brought to a boil then
      simmered covered for 15-20 minutes until water is absorbed. Let it rest
      for 5 minutes off the heat before fluffing with a fork.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      While the beef marinates and rice cooks, thinly slice 1 large *cucumber*.
      In a small bowl, whisk together 30ml *rice vinegar*, 5g *granulated
      sugar*, and a pinch of salt until the sugar dissolves. Add the sliced
      *cucumber* and toss to coat. Set aside to quick pickle.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Heat a large skillet or wok over high heat and add a drizzle of *vegetable
      oil*. Once hot, add a single layer of the marinated *beef* (do not
      overcrowd the pan, cook in batches if necessary). Cook for 2-3 minutes per
      side until browned and caramelized. Transfer cooked beef to a plate and
      repeat with remaining beef.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Divide the cooked *short-grain white rice* among four serving bowls. Top
      each with a generous portion of the cooked *bulgogi beef*. Add a side of
      200g *kimchi* and the *quick pickled cucumbers*. Garnish with thinly
      sliced *green onions* and 5g *toasted sesame seeds*. Serve immediately.
