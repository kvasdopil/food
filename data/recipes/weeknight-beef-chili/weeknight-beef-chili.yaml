instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F). Line a large baking sheet with parchment
      paper.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Peel sweet potatoes and cut them into 1/4-inch thick fries. In a bowl,
      toss the sweet potato fries with 1 tbsp olive oil and 1/2 tsp salt. Spread
      them in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 25-30
      minutes, flipping halfway through, until tender and lightly browned.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      While the sweet potatoes bake, heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a large pot or
      Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook, breaking
      it up with a spoon, until it is fully browned, about 5-7 minutes. Drain
      any excess fat.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Add the diced onion to the pot with the beef and cook until softened,
      about 3-5 minutes. Stir in the minced garlic, chili powder, ground cumin,
      smoked paprika, cayenne pepper (if using), 1 tsp salt, and 1/2 tsp black
      pepper. Cook for 1 minute more, stirring constantly, until fragrant.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Stir in the undrained diced tomatoes, rinsed and drained kidney beans,
      rinsed and drained black beans, and beef broth. Bring the mixture to a
      simmer, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for 15-20
      minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Taste the chili and adjust seasonings if necessary. Serve the hot chili
      alongside the crispy baked sweet potato fries. Garnish with shredded
      cheddar cheese, a dollop of sour cream, and fresh cilantro, if desired.
