instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: Preheat oven to 200Â°C. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Peel *sweet potatoes* and cut them into fries about 1 cm thick. In a bowl, toss the sweet potato fries with 1 tbsp
      *olive oil* and 1/2 tsp *salt*. Spread them in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet and bake for 25-30
      minutes, flipping halfway through, until tender and lightly browned.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      While the *sweet potatoes* bake, heat 1 tbsp *olive oil* in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add
      the *lean ground beef* and cook, breaking it up with a spoon, until it is fully browned, about 5-7 minutes. Drain
      any excess fat.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Add the diced *onion* to the pot with the lean ground beef and cook until softened, about 3-5 minutes. Stir in the
      minced *garlic*, *chili powder*, *ground cumin*, *smoked paprika*, *cayenne pepper* (if using), 1 tsp *salt*, and
      1/2 tsp *black pepper*. Cook for 1 minute more, stirring constantly, until fragrant.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Stir in the undrained *diced tomatoes*, rinsed and drained *kidney beans*, rinsed and drained *black beans*, and
      *beef broth*. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low, cover, and let it simmer for 15-20
      minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Taste the chili and adjust seasonings if necessary. Serve the hot chili alongside the crispy baked sweet potato
      fries. Garnish with *shredded cheddar cheese*, a dollop of *sour cream*, and *fresh cilantro*, if desired.
