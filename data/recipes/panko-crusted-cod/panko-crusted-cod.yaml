instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat the oven to 200Â°C. Place quartered potatoes in a medium pot,
      cover with cold water by about 2.5 cm, and add 1/2 teaspoon salt. Bring
      to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until very tender, about 15-20
      minutes.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      While potatoes cook, pat cod fillets dry with paper towels. Season both
      sides with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. In a shallow
      dish, combine panko breadcrumbs, the zest of 1 lemon, and 1/4 teaspoon
      black pepper. Drizzle cod fillets with 1 tablespoon olive oil, then dredge
      each fillet in the panko mixture, pressing gently to ensure a golden
      crunchy coating adheres.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Place coated cod fillets on a lightly oiled baking sheet. Bake for 12-15
      minutes, or until the cod is opaque and flakes easily with a fork, and the
      panko is golden brown. While cod bakes, drain cooked potatoes. Return to
      the hot pot. Add minced garlic, remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil, butter,
      and milk. Mash until silky smooth, seasoning with additional salt and
      pepper to taste.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      In a small saucepan, bring a small amount of water to a boil. Add frozen
      peas and steam for 3-4 minutes, or until tender-crisp. Drain well. Serve
      the panko-crusted cod immediately with the silky garlic mashed potatoes
      and steamed peas, garnished with fresh lemon wedges if desired.
