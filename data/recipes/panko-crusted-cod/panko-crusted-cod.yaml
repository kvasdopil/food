instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat the oven to 200Â°C. Place quartered *potatoes* in a medium pot, cover with cold water by about 2.5 cm, and
      add 1/2 tsp *salt*. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer until very tender, about 15-20 minutes.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      While *potatoes* cook, pat *cod fillets* dry. Season both sides with 1/2 tsp *salt* and 1/4 tsp *black pepper*. In
      a shallow dish, combine *panko breadcrumbs*, the zest of 1 *lemon*, and 1/4 tsp black pepper. Coat the *cod
      fillets* with 1 tbsp *olive oil*, then dredge each fillet in the panko mixture, pressing gently to ensure a golden
      crunchy coating adheres.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Place coated *cod fillets* on a baking sheet lightly brushed with *olive oil*. Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until
      the cod is opaque and flakes easily with a fork, and the panko is golden brown. While cod bakes, drain cooked
      *potatoes*. Return to the hot pot. Add minced *garlic*, remaining 1 tbsp *olive oil*, *butter*, and *milk*. Mash
      until silky smooth, seasoning with additional *salt* and *black pepper* to taste.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      In a small saucepan, bring a small amount of water to a boil. Add *frozen peas* and steam for 3-4 minutes, or
      until tender-crisp. Drain well. Serve the panko-crusted cod immediately with the silky *garlic* mashed *potatoes*
      and steamed peas, garnished with fresh *lemon* wedges if desired.
