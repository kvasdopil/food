instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Heat a large, deep skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add a
      drizzle of *olive oil*. Add the *sweet italian sausage*
      and break it up with a spoon. Cook for 8-10 minutes, browning it evenly,
      until no pink remains. Remove the cooked sausage with a slotted spoon and
      set aside, leaving about 1 tbsp of rendered fat in the pan.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Reduce heat to medium. Add the *yellow onion* to the skillet and cook for
      5-7 minutes until softened and translucent, scraping up any browned bits
      from the bottom of the pan. Add the *garlic cloves* and cook for another
      minute until fragrant, being careful not to burn it.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Stir in the *canned crushed tomatoes*, *dried oregano*, and *red pepper
      flakes*. Return the cooked sausage to the pan. Bring the sauce
      to a simmer, then reduce heat to low, cover, and let it gently cook for at
      least 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, to allow the flavors to meld.
      Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      While the sauce simmers, bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling
      boil. Add the *rigatoni pasta* and cook according to package directions
      until al dente (usually 10-12 minutes). Reserve about 120 ml of the pasta
      cooking water before draining the pasta.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Once the pasta is cooked, add the drained *rigatoni pasta* directly to the
      simmering sauce. Stir in the chopped *fresh basil* and *fresh parsley*,
      and the *parmesan cheese*. If the sauce seems too thick, add a splash of
      the reserved pasta cooking water until it reaches your desired
      consistency. Toss everything together until the pasta is well coated.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Serve immediately, garnished with extra fresh basil and parmesan cheese.
      This dish pairs wonderfully with slices of warm rosemary focaccia.
