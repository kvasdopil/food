instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Combine *ground beef*, *breadcrumbs*, *egg*, 2 minced *garlic* cloves, 1/2
      tsp *dried oregano*, a pinch of salt and pepper in a bowl. Mix until just
      combined, then form into 16-20 small meatballs (approx. 3 cm diameter).
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan or pot over medium-high heat.
      Add the *meatballs* and brown them on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove
      meatballs from the pan and set aside.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Reduce heat to medium. Add the *finely chopped onion* to the same pan and
      cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the remaining 2 minced *garlic*
      cloves and cook for another minute until fragrant.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Pour in the *canned crushed tomatoes*, the remaining 1/2 tsp *dried
      oregano*, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Bring to a simmer, then return
      the browned *meatballs* to the sauce. Cover and simmer gently for 15-20
      minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and meatballs to cook through.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      While the meatballs simmer, preheat your oven to 200°C (or broiler). Slice
      *sub rolls* lengthwise, almost all the way through, and lightly toast them
      in the oven for 3-5 minutes until warm and slightly crisp.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Fill each toasted *sub roll* generously with the saucy *meatballs*. Top
      with *shredded mozzarella cheese*. Place the filled rolls back on a baking
      tray.
  - step: 7
    action: >-
      Bake for 5-7 minutes, or until the *mozzarella cheese* is melted and
      bubbly. If desired, broil for the last minute for a golden-brown crust on
      the cheese, watching carefully to prevent burning.
  - step: 8
    action: >-
      Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the *chopped romaine lettuce* with
      *caesar dressing* and half of the *grated parmesan cheese*. Toss to coat.
  - step: 9
    action: >-
      Serve the hot *meatball marinara subs* immediately, accompanied by the
      fresh *Caesar salad* and extra *parmesan cheese* for sprinkling.
