instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat your oven to 200Â°C. In a large bowl, combine the *chicken breast*
      strips with 15 ml of *olive oil*, *cumin powder*, *paprika*, *coriander
      powder*, *turmeric*, *cinnamon*, a pinch of salt, and a grind of black
      pepper. Toss well to coat. On a separate section of the same large baking
      sheet, spread the *chickpeas* and drizzle with the remaining 15 ml of
      olive oil, salt, and pepper.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Place the baking sheet with the *chicken breast* and chickpeas into the
      preheated oven. Roast for 20-25 minutes, flipping the chicken and stirring
      the chickpeas halfway through, until the chicken is cooked through and the
      chickpeas are lightly crisped.
  - step: 3

      While the chicken and chickpeas roast, cook the *basmati rice* according
      to package instructions.

      Prepare the tahini sauce. In a small bowl, whisk together the *tahini*,
      *lemon* juice, *minced garlic*, *plain yoghurt*, and 30-60 ml of cold
      water until smooth and a pourable consistency is reached. Season the sauce
      with salt and pepper to taste.
