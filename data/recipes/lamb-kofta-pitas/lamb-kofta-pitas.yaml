instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Finely chop half of the *small onion* and mince 2 cloves of *garlic*. Chop
      30g of *fresh parsley*. In a large bowl, combine the 500g of *ground lamb*
      with the chopped onion, minced garlic, chopped parsley, 1 tsp of *ground
      cumin*, 1 tsp of *ground coriander*, and 0.5 tsp of *smoked paprika*.
      Season generously with salt and black pepper, then mix everything
      thoroughly with your hands until well combined.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Divide the *lamb mixture* into 8-10 equal portions and shape them into
      small, oblong patties (kofta). Heat a drizzle of *olive oil* in a large
      non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook the *kofta* for 4-5
      minutes per side, or until browned and cooked through. Set aside on a
      plate.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Grate half of the *cucumber* and squeeze out excess water using a paper
      towel or clean cloth. Mince the remaining 1 clove of *garlic*. Chop 15g of
      *fresh mint*. In a small bowl, combine 200g of *plain yogurt*, the grated
      cucumber, minced garlic, chopped mint, and the juice of half a *lemon*.
      Season with salt and pepper to taste and mix well.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Dice the 2 *tomatoes* and the remaining half *cucumber*. Thinly slice the
      remaining quarter of the *small onion*. Chop the remaining 15g of *fresh
      parsley*. In a medium bowl, combine the diced tomatoes, cucumber, sliced
      onion, and chopped parsley. Drizzle with 1 tbsp of *olive oil* and the
      juice of the remaining half *lemon*. Season with salt and pepper, then
      toss gently to combine.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Warm the 4 *pita breads* in a dry frying pan, oven, or microwave until
      soft and pliable. Carefully open each *pita bread* to form a pocket. Fill
      each *pita* with a few *lamb kofta patties*, a generous spoonful of the
      *cucumber yogurt sauce*, and some of the *tomato-cucumber salad*. Serve
      immediately with any remaining salad on the side.
