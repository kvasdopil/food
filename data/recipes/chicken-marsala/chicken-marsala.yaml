instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Prepare the chicken and potatoes: Place the *chicken breasts* between two
      sheets of cling film and pound them to an even 1.5 cm thickness. Peel and
      quarter the *potatoes*. Place the quartered *potatoes* in a large pot,
      cover with cold water, add a pinch of *salt*, and bring to a boil. Cook
      until fork-tender, about 15-20 minutes.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Sear the chicken: While potatoes cook, season the pounded *chicken
      breasts* with *salt* and *black pepper*. Dredge each piece lightly in
      *all-purpose flour*, shaking off any excess. Heat a drizzle of *olive oil*
      and 30g of *unsalted butter* in a large frying pan over medium-high heat.
      Sear the *chicken breasts* for 3-4 minutes per side until golden brown and
      cooked through. Remove chicken from the pan and set aside.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Make the Marsala sauce: In the same pan, add the chopped *shallot* and
      cook for 2 minutes until softened. Add the *garlic cloves* and
      *cremini or button mushrooms* and cook for 5-7 minutes until
      mushrooms are tender and browned. Deglaze the pan with *dry Marsala wine*,
      scraping up any browned bits from the bottom, and let it reduce by half,
      about 2 minutes.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Finish the sauce and chicken: Pour in the *chicken broth* and bring to a
      simmer, cooking for 3-5 minutes until the sauce slightly thickens. Stir in
      the *heavy cream*. Return the seared *chicken breasts* to the pan, turning
      to coat them in the sauce. Let simmer gently for 2-3 minutes to heat
      through.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Finish the mashed potatoes: Drain the cooked *potatoes* thoroughly. Return
      them to the hot pot. Add the remaining 60g of *unsalted butter* and the
      *milk*. Mash until smooth and creamy. Season with *salt* and *black
      pepper* to taste.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Serve: Plate the creamy *potatoes* alongside the chicken Marsala.
      Garnish with freshly chopped *fresh parsley*.
