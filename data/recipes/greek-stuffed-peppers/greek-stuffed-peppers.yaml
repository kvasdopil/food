instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking
      dish. Prepare the bell peppers by halving them lengthwise and removing the
      seeds and membranes.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      In a medium saucepan, combine the uncooked rice with 1.5 cups of vegetable
      broth. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10
      minutes. The rice will be partially cooked.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      While the rice cooks, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.
      Add the chopped onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the
      minced garlic and tomato paste, cooking for another minute until fragrant.
      Stir in the drained diced tomatoes and dried oregano, cooking for 2-3
      minutes.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Remove the skillet from heat. Stir in the partially cooked rice, crumbled
      feta cheese, chopped Kalamata olives, and fresh parsley. Season the
      filling with salt and black pepper to taste. Mix well to combine.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Arrange the pepper halves in the prepared baking dish. Spoon the rice
      mixture evenly into each pepper half. Pour the remaining 1/2 cup of
      vegetable broth into the bottom of the baking dish. Cover the dish tightly
      with foil.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking for another 10-15
      minutes, or until the peppers are tender and the filling is heated through
      and slightly golden on top. While the peppers bake uncovered, prepare the
      quick cucumber salad by combining diced cucumber, lemon juice, chopped
      fresh dill (if using), and a pinch of salt and pepper in a small bowl.
  - step: 7
    action: >-
      Serve the hot stuffed peppers immediately with the refreshing lemony
      cucumber salad on the side.

    Golden-brown Greek Stuffed Pepper halves, brimming with herbed rice, feta,
    and olives, elegantly rest on a matte white ceramic plate. A vibrant side of
    lemony cucumber salad, fresh dill, and crumbled feta garnish adds a burst of
    freshness. Soft, diffused natural window light illuminates, creating gentle
    highlights and inviting shadows. Extremely shallow depth of field focuses
    sharply on the glistening filling and subtle rising steam.
