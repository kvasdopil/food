instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat your oven to 190Â°C. Lightly grease a 23x33 cm baking dish. Prepare the *bell peppers* by halving them
      lengthwise and removing the seeds and membranes.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      In a medium saucepan, combine the uncooked *rice* with 375 ml of *vegetable broth*. Bring to a boil, then reduce
      heat to low, cover, and simmer for 10 minutes. The rice will be partially cooked.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      While the *rice* cooks, heat *olive oil* in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chopped *onion* and cook
      until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the minced *garlic cloves* and *tomato paste*, cooking for another minute until
      fragrant. Stir in the drained *diced tomatoes* and *dried oregano*, cooking for 2-3 minutes.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Remove the skillet from heat. Stir in the partially cooked *rice*, crumbled *feta cheese*, chopped *kalamata
      olives*, and *fresh parsley*. Season the filling with *salt* and *black pepper* to taste. Mix well to combine.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Arrange the halved *bell peppers* in the prepared baking dish. Spoon the *rice* mixture evenly into each pepper half.
      Pour the remaining 125 ml of *vegetable broth* into the bottom of the baking dish. Cover the dish tightly with
      foil.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and continue baking for another 10-15 minutes, or until the *peppers* are
      tender and the filling is heated through and slightly golden on top. While the peppers bake uncovered, prepare the
      quick *cucumber* salad by combining diced cucumber, *lemon juice*, chopped *fresh dill* (if using), and a pinch of
      salt and black pepper in a small bowl.
  - step: 7
    action: Serve the hot stuffed peppers immediately with the refreshing lemony cucumber salad on the side.
