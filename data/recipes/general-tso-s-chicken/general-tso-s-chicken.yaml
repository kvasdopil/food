instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Rinse *basmati rice* thoroughly, then cook according to package
      instructions. While the rice cooks, steam *broccoli florets* until
      tender-crisp, about 5-7 minutes. Set aside.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Prepare the chicken: In a medium bowl, combine the *chicken breast* pieces
      with 15 ml of the *soy sauce*, the *egg*, and *white pepper*. Mix well and
      let marinate for 5-10 minutes.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Make the General Tso's Sauce: In a separate small bowl, whisk together the
      remaining 30 ml *soy sauce*, *rice vinegar*, *granulated sugar*, *hoisin
      sauce*, 15g of the *cornflour*, and *water* (or chicken stock). Set aside.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Coat and fry chicken: Place the remaining 60g *cornflour* in a shallow
      dish. Dredge each piece of marinated chicken in the cornflour, ensuring
      it's fully coated. Heat *vegetable oil* in a large wok or deep pan over
      medium-high heat. Fry the coated chicken in batches for 3-4 minutes per
      batch, until golden brown and crispy. Remove with a slotted spoon and
      drain on a wire rack or paper towels.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Cook the sauce: Carefully pour out most of the oil from the wok, leaving
      about a drizzle. Add *minced fresh ginger*, *minced garlic cloves*, and
      *dried red chillies* (if using) to the wok. SautÃ© for 30 seconds until
      fragrant.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Combine and serve: Pour the prepared General Tso's sauce into the wok.
      Bring to a simmer, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens. Add the
      crispy chicken back into the wok and toss until all pieces are evenly
      coated. Serve immediately with the cooked rice and steamed broccoli.
      Garnish with *sliced spring onions* and *sesame seeds*.
