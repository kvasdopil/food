instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat your oven to 200Â°C or turn on the broiler to high. On a small
      baking tray, toss the *cherry tomatoes* with a drizzle of olive oil, salt,
      and pepper. Roast for 15-20 minutes until softened and slightly burst, or
      until the gnocchi is ready.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Heat 1 tbsp of *olive oil* in a large, oven-safe skillet over medium heat.
      Add the *minced garlic* and cook for 30 seconds until fragrant. Stir in
      the *drained and roughly chopped canned artichoke hearts* and cook for 2
      minutes.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Add the *fresh spinach* to the skillet, stirring until it wilts down,
      about 2-3 minutes. Pour in the *vegetable broth* and *cooking cream*, then
      add the *potato gnocchi*. Stir well to combine, cover the skillet, and
      simmer for 5-7 minutes, or until the gnocchi are tender.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Remove the skillet from the heat. Stir in the *grated parmesan cheese*,
      *lemon juice* (if using), and *red pepper flakes* (if using). Season with
      salt and pepper to taste.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      If your skillet is oven-safe, place it directly under the broiler for 2-3
      minutes, watching carefully, until the top is bubbly and lightly golden.
      If not, transfer the gnocchi mixture to an oven-safe dish before broiling.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Serve the skillet gnocchi immediately, topped with the roasted *cherry
      tomatoes* and extra grated parmesan cheese, if desired.
