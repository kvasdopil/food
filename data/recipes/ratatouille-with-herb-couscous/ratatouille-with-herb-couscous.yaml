  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Sauté the ratatouille base: Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a large pan or
      pot over medium-high heat. Add the diced *eggplant*, *courgette*, *red
      bell pepper*, *yellow bell pepper*, and chopped *onion*. Cook for 8-10
      minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables begin to soften and
      lightly brown. Stir in the minced *garlic* and *dried oregano*, cooking
      for another minute until fragrant.
  - step: 3

      Simmer the ratatouille: Pour in the *chopped tomatoes* and *vegetable
      stock*. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer, then reduce the heat to
      medium-low, cover, and let it cook for 15-20 minutes, or until all the
      vegetables are tender. Season generously with salt and black pepper to
      taste.

      Prepare the herb couscous: While the ratatouille simmers, bring 250ml of
      water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add a pinch of salt. Remove from
      heat, stir in the *couscous*, cover the pan, and let it stand for 5
      minutes. Fluff the couscous with a fork, then stir in the chopped *fresh
      parsley* and *fresh mint*.

      lettuce*. In a small bowl, whisk together a drizzle of olive oil, the

      the lettuce with the simple dressing just before serving.
