instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Prepare the Pork and Breading Station: If your *pork loin cutlets* are
      thick, place each between two sheets of cling film and pound thinly to
      about 4-5 mm thickness. Set up a breading station: one shallow dish with
      *plain flour*, seasoned with salt and pepper; a second dish with the
      *large eggs*, lightly beaten; and a third dish with *panko breadcrumbs*.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Start the Potato Salad: Wash and peel the *waxy potatoes* (if desired, or
      scrub well if keeping skins). Cut them into roughly 2 cm cubes. Place the
      *waxy potatoes* in a pot, cover with cold water, add a pinch of salt, and
      bring to a boil. Cook for 10-15 minutes, or until fork-tender but not
      mushy. While potatoes cook, finely dice the *red onion* and roughly chop
      the *fresh parsley*. In a small bowl, whisk together the *white wine
      vinegar*, *dijon mustard*, a drizzle of *olive oil*, salt, and pepper to
      make the dressing.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Bread and Fry the Schnitzel: While potatoes boil, dredge each *pork
      cutlet* first in the *plain flour*, shaking off excess, then dip in the
      *large eggs*, letting excess drip off, and finally coat thoroughly in the
      *panko breadcrumbs*, pressing gently to adhere. Heat a generous amount of
      *olive oil* (about 1 cm deep) in a large frying pan over medium-high heat.
      Once hot, carefully place 1-2 *breaded pork cutlets* in the pan, ensuring
      not to overcrowd. Fry for 3-4 minutes per side, until golden brown and
      cooked through. Remove to a wire rack lined with paper towels to drain.
      Repeat with remaining *pork cutlets*.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Finish the Potato Salad and Serve: Once the *waxy potatoes* are cooked,
      drain them thoroughly and immediately transfer to a large bowl. Add the
      diced *red onion* and chopped *fresh parsley* to the warm *waxy potatoes*.
      Pour the prepared *white wine vinegar* dressing over the *waxy potatoes*
      and gently toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Garnish and Serve: Cut one *lemon* into wedges. Serve the *pork schnitzel*
      immediately with a *lemon* wedge and a generous portion of the *warm
      potato salad*. Squeeze fresh *lemon* juice over the schnitzel before
      eating.
