instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat your oven to 200Â°C. Line a large sheet pan with baking paper.
      Place the chopped *carrots* on one side of the pan, drizzle with a little
      olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Roast for 10 minutes.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      While the carrots roast, prepare the *wild rice blend*. In a medium
      saucepan, bring the *vegetable broth* to a boil. Add the *quick-cook wild
      rice blend*, reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer according to package
      directions (typically 10-15 minutes), until the liquid is absorbed.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      In a small bowl, whisk together the *honey*, *Dijon mustard*, *garlic
      powder*, a drizzle of olive oil, and a pinch of salt and pepper to create
      the honey mustard glaze.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      After the carrots have roasted for 10 minutes, remove the sheet pan from
      the oven. Arrange the *salmon fillets* on the other side of the pan. Brush
      generously with the *honey mustard glaze*. Return the sheet pan to the
      oven and continue roasting for another 12-15 minutes, or until the salmon
      is cooked through and flakes easily with a fork, and the carrots are
      tender.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Once cooked, remove the sheet pan from the oven. Fluff the cooked *wild
      rice blend* with a fork. Serve the honey mustard salmon and roasted
      carrots alongside the wild rice pilaf, garnished with fresh chopped *fresh
      parsley*.
