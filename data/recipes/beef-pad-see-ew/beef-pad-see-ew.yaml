    action: >-
      Prepare the cucumber salad: In a small bowl, combine sliced *cucumber*,
      *red bird's eye chili*, and *white vinegar*. Add a pinch of sugar and
      salt, then set aside to marinate while you prepare the main dish.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Marinate the beef: In a separate bowl, toss the sliced *beef sirloin* with
      1 tbsp of the *light soy sauce* and 1 tbsp of the *neutral oil*. Set
      aside. If using dried wide rice noodles, prepare them according to package
      instructions and drain well.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Make the stir-fry sauce: In a small bowl, whisk together the remaining 1
      tbsp *light soy sauce*, *dark sweet soy sauce*, *oyster sauce*, and *white
      granulated sugar*. Set aside.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Stir-fry the beef: Heat 1 tbsp of *neutral oil* in a large wok or skillet
      over high heat until smoking. Add the marinated beef in a single layer and
      sear for 1-2 minutes per side until browned. Remove beef from the wok and
      set aside.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Cook the broccoli and garlic: Add another 1 tbsp of *neutral oil* to the
      wok. Add the *broccoli florets* and stir-fry for 2-3 minutes until bright

      30 seconds until fragrant.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Combine noodles and sauce: Add the *fresh wide rice noodles* (or prepared
      dried noodles) to the wok. Pour the prepared stir-fry sauce over the
      noodles. Toss everything together vigorously for 1-2 minutes, ensuring the
      noodles are evenly coated and slightly caramelized. If the noodles stick,
      add a tiny splash of water.
  - step: 7
    action: >-
      Add eggs and beef: Push the noodles and vegetables to one side of the wok.
      Pour the *lightly beaten eggs* into the empty side and scramble until just

      together to combine.
