instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Boil *new potatoes* in salted water until fork-tender, about 15-20
      minutes. Drain and let cool slightly, then halve. Bring a small pot of
      salted water to a boil. Add *green beans* and blanch for 3-4 minutes until
      tender-crisp. Immediately transfer to an ice bath to stop cooking, then
      drain. Halve the *cherry tomatoes*. Thinly slice the *red onion*.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      In a separate small pot, bring water to a boil. Carefully add *eggs* and
      boil for 7-8 minutes for medium-boiled yolks. Transfer to an ice bath,
      then peel and quarter. Heat a drizzle of *olive oil* in a non-stick pan over
      high heat. Season *tuna steaks* with salt and pepper. Sear for 1-2 minutes
      per side for rare/medium-rare, or longer to desired doneness. Remove from
      pan and slice thickly.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      In a small bowl, whisk together *dijon mustard*, *red wine vinegar*,
      *garlic*, a pinch of salt, and a grind of black pepper. Slowly
      drizzle in 80 ml *olive oil* while whisking continuously until emulsified.
      Taste and adjust seasoning.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Arrange the *butter lettuce* leaves on two plates. Artfully arrange the
      *potatoes*, *green beans*, *cherry tomatoes*, *black olives*, *red onion*,
      sliced *tuna steaks*, and quartered *eggs* over the lettuce. Drizzle
      generously with the prepared dressing just before serving.
