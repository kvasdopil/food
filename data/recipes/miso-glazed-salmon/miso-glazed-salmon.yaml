instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Cook the Rice. Rinse *jasmine rice* under cold water until water runs
      clear. Combine *jasmine rice* and *water* in a small saucepan. Bring to a
      boil, then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 12-15 minutes, or
      until all water is absorbed. Let stand, covered, for 5 minutes, then fluff
      with a fork.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Prepare Miso Glaze and Salmon. In a small bowl, whisk together *white miso
      paste*, *mirin*, *sake*, *soy sauce*, 1 tsp *sesame oil*, *brown sugar*,
      and grated *fresh ginger*. Pat *salmon fillets* dry with paper towels.
      Season lightly with salt and pepper. Place salmon on a foil-lined baking
      tray. Brush about half of the miso glaze generously over the top of the
      *salmon fillets*.
  - step: 3
    action: Prepare Bok Choy. Wash and halve *bok choy* lengthwise.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Broil the Salmon. Preheat broiler to high. Broil the *salmon fillets* for
      8-12 minutes, depending on thickness, until cooked through and lightly
      caramelized, brushing with remaining glaze halfway through cooking. Watch
      carefully to prevent burning.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Sauté the Bok Choy. While salmon broils, heat a drizzle of vegetable oil
      in a large pan or wok over medium-high heat. Add minced *garlic* and sauté
      for 30 seconds until fragrant. Add the halved *bok choy* and sauté for 3-5
      minutes, tossing occasionally, until tender-crisp. Drizzle with the
      remaining 1 tsp *sesame oil* and a pinch of salt.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Serve. Divide the cooked *jasmine rice* among plates. Place a *salmon
      fillet* next to the rice and arrange the *bok choy* alongside. Garnish
      with *toasted sesame seeds* and sliced *green onions*.

    A tantalizing, golden-lacquered miso salmon fillet, perfectly flaky, takes
    center stage. Nestled beside it, a pristine mound of fluffy jasmine rice and
    vibrant, sesame-dusted bok choy. Emphasize the glistening sweet-savory glaze
    and delicate garnishes: finely sliced scallions and toasted sesame seeds.
    Bathed in soft, warm side-light, a slightly elevated eye-level perspective
    with shallow depth of field creates an intimate, comforting scene. No steam,
    no brands, no people.
