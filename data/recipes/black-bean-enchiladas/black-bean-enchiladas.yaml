instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: Preheat your oven to 190°C. Lightly grease a 23x33 cm baking dish.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      In a large pan or skillet, heat the *vegetable oil* over medium heat. Add the chopped *onion* and sauté for 5-7
      minutes until softened. Add the minced *garlic cloves*, *ground cumin*, *chili powder*, and *smoked paprika*, cooking for
      another minute until fragrant.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Stir in the drained and rinsed *black beans*. Cook for 5-7 minutes, using a fork or potato masher to mash about
      half of the beans. This creates a creamy, substantial filling. Season with *salt* and *black pepper* to taste.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Warm the *corn tortillas* slightly to make them pliable. You can do this in a microwave for 15-20 seconds or
      quickly in a dry pan. Spoon approximately 60 g of the *black bean* mixture and a sprinkle of shredded *cheese*
      into the center of each tortilla. Roll tightly and place seam-down in the prepared baking dish.
  - step: 5
    action: Pour the *enchilada sauce* evenly over the rolled *tortillas*. Top with the remaining shredded *cheese*.
  - step: 6
    action: Bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the *cheese* is melted and bubbly and the enchiladas are heated through.
  - step: 7
    action: >-
      While the enchiladas bake, cook the *quick-cook white rice* according to package directions. Once cooked, stir in
      half of the chopped *fresh cilantro* and a squeeze of *lime* juice from one of the lime wedges.
  - step: 8
    action: >-
      Serve the *black bean* enchiladas hot, garnished with the remaining *fresh cilantro* and *lime* wedges, alongside
      the cilantro-lime *rice*.
