      In a saucepan or microwave-safe bowl, combine *pre-cooked shredded pork*

      halfway.

      through, about 5 minutes.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Lightly toast the *slider buns* in a dry pan, under a grill, or in a
      toaster oven for 1-2 minutes until lightly golden.
  - step: 5

      Open each toasted slider bun. Pile a generous spoonful of the hot bbq pork
      onto the bottom half of each bun. Top the pork with a spoonful of the
      prepared slaw. Place the top bun half on.

      Arrange the finished sliders on a platter. Serve immediately with the warm
      baked beans on the side.
