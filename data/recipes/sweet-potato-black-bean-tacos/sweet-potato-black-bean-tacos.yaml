      Preheat your oven to 200Â°C. In a large bowl, toss the diced *sweet potatoes* with 15 ml of *olive oil*, 5 ml of
      *chili powder*, 5 ml of *ground cumin*, the *smoked paprika*, 2.5 ml of *salt*, and all of the *black pepper*.
      Spread them in a single layer on a baking tray.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Roast the *sweet potatoes* for 20-25 minutes, or until tender and lightly caramelized, flipping halfway through.
      During the last 5 minutes of roasting, add the rinsed *black beans* to the tray with the sweet potatoes to warm
      through.
  - step: 3

      While the *sweet potatoes* roast, prepare the charred street-*corn* salad. Heat a frying pan over medium-high heat
      with a drizzle of *olive oil*. Add the corn and cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until some kernels
      are lightly charred. Transfer to a bowl and mix with the diced *red onion*, 20 g of chopped *cilantro*, the juice
      of one *lime*, the remaining 5 ml of *chili powder*, and 5 ml of *ground cumin*. Season with *salt* to taste.
  - step: 4

      For the *lime* crema, combine the *sour cream* (or vegan alternative) in a small bowl with the zest and juice of
      one lime and 2.5 ml of *salt*. Mix well until smooth.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Warm the *corn tortillas* according to package directions, either in a dry pan, microwave, or wrapped in foil in
      the oven for a few minutes.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Assemble the tacos by spooning the roasted sweet potato and *black bean* mixture into the warm *tortillas*. Top
      with a generous dollop of *lime* crema, a spoonful of the charred street-*corn* salad, and a sprinkle of *fresh
      cilantro*. Serve immediately with extra lime wedges.
