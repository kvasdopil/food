instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Prepare the marinade: In a medium bowl, combine the juice and zest of 1
      large *lemon*, 2 tsp *dried oregano*, 2 minced *garlic* cloves, and 30 ml
      *olive oil*. Season generously with salt and black pepper.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Marinate chicken: Add the 500 g *chicken breast* cubes to the marinade,
      toss well to coat, and let it marinate at room temperature for at least 15
      minutes, or refrigerate for up to 30 minutes if time allows.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Prepare the salad: While the chicken marinates, combine the 1 medium
      diced *cucumber*, 2 medium diced *tomatoes*, 0.5 small thinly sliced *red
      onion*, and 2 tbsp chopped *fresh parsley* in a separate bowl. Drizzle
      with the remaining 30 ml olive oil, a squeeze of lemon juice, and season
      with salt and pepper. Toss gently to combine.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Skewer the chicken: Thread the marinated chicken cubes onto metal or
      pre-soaked wooden skewers (approximately 4-5 pieces per skewer).
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Cook the chicken: Heat a grill pan or outdoor grill to medium-high heat.
      Lightly brush the grill with olive oil. Place the *skewered chicken* on
      the hot grill and cook for 3-4 minutes per side, turning occasionally,
      until the chicken is cooked through and has light char marks.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Warm the pita: While the chicken cooks, warm the *pita bread* directly on
      the grill for about 30 seconds per side, or in a microwave or oven until
      soft and pliable.
  - step: 7
    action: >-
      Assemble plates: Serve the *grilled chicken souvlaki* immediately with the
      fresh *tomato-cucumber salad* and warm pita bread on the side.
