instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat oven to 200°C. Wash and halve the *potatoes*. Mince the *garlic*
      cloves.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      In a bowl, toss the halved potatoes with 1 tbsp *olive oil*, the minced
      garlic, a pinch of salt, and a grind of black pepper. Spread the potatoes
      in a single layer on a baking tray. Roast for 20-25 minutes, or until
      tender and slightly crispy.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      While the potatoes roast, pat the *chicken breast* pieces dry with paper
      towels. Season both sides with salt and pepper. Heat 1 tbsp *olive oil* in a
      large skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken breasts for 5-7
      minutes per side until golden brown and cooked through (internal
      temperature reaches 74°C). Remove the chicken from the skillet and set
      aside on a plate.
  - step: 4

      Add the *cherry tomatoes* to the same skillet. Cook for 3-5 minutes,
      stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes begin to soften and burst.
      Return the cooked chicken to the skillet. Stir in the *basil pesto*,
      ensuring the chicken and tomatoes are well coated.

      Serve the pesto chicken and tomatoes immediately alongside the roasted
      potatoes. Garnish with *fresh basil* leaves and a sprinkle of grated
      *parmesan cheese* if desired.
