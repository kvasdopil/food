instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a large baking sheet with
      parchment paper. In a large bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour,
      cornstarch, garlic powder, onion powder, smoked paprika, 1/2 teaspoon
      salt, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Gradually whisk in the 1/2 cup water
      until a smooth, thick batter forms. Add the cauliflower florets to the
      batter and toss until each piece is evenly coated.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Spread the coated cauliflower in a single layer on the prepared baking
      sheet. Bake for 20-25 minutes, flipping the florets halfway through, until
      they are golden brown and crispy.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      While the cauliflower bakes, prepare the slaw. In a medium bowl, combine
      the shredded cabbage and shredded carrot. In a small separate bowl, whisk
      together the vegan mayonnaise, apple cider vinegar, maple syrup, a pinch
      of salt, and a pinch of black pepper. Pour the dressing over the cabbage
      and carrot mixture and toss well to combine.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Once the cauliflower is crispy, remove it from the oven. Transfer the hot
      cauliflower back into the large bowl (or a clean one). Pour the buffalo
      wing sauce over the cauliflower and toss gently until all florets are
      thoroughly coated.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Warm the flour tortillas according to package directions (typically 15-30
      seconds in the microwave, or briefly in a dry pan). Fill each warm
      tortilla with a generous portion of the buffalo cauliflower and a spoonful
      of the crunchy slaw.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Fold the tortillas into wraps and serve immediately with extra carrot and
      celery sticks on the side.
