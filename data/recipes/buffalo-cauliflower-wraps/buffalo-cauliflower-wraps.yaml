instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat your oven to 200Â°C. Line a large baking sheet with parchment
      paper. In a large bowl, whisk together the *all-purpose flour*,
      *cornstarch*, *garlic powder*, *onion powder*, *smoked paprika*, 1/2 tsp
      *salt*, and 1/4 tsp *black pepper*. Gradually whisk in the *water* until a
      smooth, thick batter forms. Add the *cauliflower* florets to the batter
      and toss until each piece is evenly coated.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Spread the coated *cauliflower* in a single layer on the prepared baking
      sheet. Bake for 20-25 minutes, flipping the florets halfway through, until
      they are golden brown and crispy.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      While the *cauliflower* bakes, prepare the slaw. In a medium bowl, combine
      the shredded *cabbage* and shredded *carrot*. In a small separate bowl,
      whisk together the *vegan mayonnaise*, *apple cider vinegar*, *maple
      syrup*, a pinch of *salt*, and a pinch of *black pepper*. Pour the
      dressing over the cabbage and carrot mixture and toss well to combine.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Once the *cauliflower* is crispy, remove it from the oven. Transfer the
      hot cauliflower back into the large bowl (or a clean one). Pour the
      *buffalo wing sauce* over the cauliflower and toss gently until all
      florets are thoroughly coated.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Warm the *flour* tortillas according to package directions (typically
      15-30 seconds in the microwave, or briefly in a dry pan). Fill each warm
      tortilla with a generous portion of the buffalo *cauliflower* and a
      spoonful of the crunchy slaw.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Fold the *tortillas* into wraps and serve immediately with extra *carrot*
      and *celery sticks* on the side.
