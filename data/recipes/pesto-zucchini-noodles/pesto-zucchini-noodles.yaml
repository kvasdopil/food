instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Prepare the bean salad: Drain and rinse the *cannellini beans*. Finely
      dice the *red onion* and chop the *fresh parsley*. In a small bowl,
      combine the beans, red onion, and parsley. Squeeze the juice of half a
      *lemon* over the mixture, add a drizzle of olive oil, and season with salt
      and black pepper. Stir well and set aside.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Prepare zucchini and tomatoes: Spiralize the *zucchini* into noodles.
      Halve the *cherry tomatoes*.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Toast pine nuts and sauté garlic: In a dry pan over medium heat, toast the
      *pine nuts* for 2-3 minutes until golden and fragrant. Remove from pan and
      set aside. Add a drizzle of olive oil to the same pan. Mince the *garlic*
      clove and add to the pan, sautéing for about 30 seconds until fragrant.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Combine and serve: Add the *zucchini noodles* to the pan with the garlic
      (no need to cook extensively, just warm slightly if desired, or keep raw
      for crunch). Remove from heat. Add the *basil pesto* and *cherry tomatoes*
      to the pan. Toss everything gently to coat the zucchini noodles evenly
      with the pesto. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Serve the
      pesto zucchini noodles immediately, topped with the toasted *pine nuts*,
      alongside the lemony cannellini bean salad.
