instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Prepare your vegetables: finely chop the onion, carrot, and celery. Mince
      the 3 garlic cloves for the bolognese sauce.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large pot or deep pan over medium
      heat. Add the chopped onion, carrot, and celery. Sauté for 5-7 minutes
      until softened.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Add the minced garlic, dried oregano, and dried basil to the pot. Cook for
      another 1 minute until fragrant, stirring constantly.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Stir in the rinsed red lentils, canned chopped tomatoes, and vegetable
      stock. Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Reduce the heat to low, cover
      the pot, and let it simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the lentils are
      tender and the sauce has thickened. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.
      Season generously with salt and black pepper to taste.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      While the bolognese simmers, bring a large pot of well-salted water to a
      rolling boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until
      al dente. Drain the pasta, reserving about 60 millilitres of the pasta
      cooking water.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      In a separate frying pan, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil
      over medium heat. Add the 2 thinly sliced garlic cloves and cook for 30
      seconds until fragrant. Add the fresh spinach and sauté for 2-3 minutes
      until completely wilted. Season with a pinch of salt.
  - step: 7
    action: >-
      Serve the hearty lentil bolognese over the cooked pasta. If the sauce is
      too thick, stir in a splash of the reserved pasta water to reach your
      desired consistency. Serve with the garlicky sautéed spinach on the side.
