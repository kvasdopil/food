instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat oven to 190Â°C. Lightly grease a 23cm x 33cm baking dish with 1 tbsp of *olive oil*. If using *fresh
      spinach*, quickly wilt it in a pan over medium heat, then squeeze out excess water and roughly chop. If using
      frozen, thaw and squeeze dry, then chop.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Cook the *jumbo pasta shells* according to package directions until al dente. Drain well and rinse with cold water
      to prevent sticking. Lay them out on a clean surface or baking sheet to cool slightly.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      In a large bowl, combine the *ricotta cheese*, wilted and chopped *fresh spinach*, beaten *large egg*, minced
      *garlic*, *dried oregano*, chopped *fresh parsley*, 0.5 tsp *salt*, and 0.25 tsp *black pepper*. Mix thoroughly
      until all ingredients are well combined.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Spread half of the *marinara sauce* evenly over the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Carefully stuff each
      cooked *jumbo pasta shells* with approximately 1-2 tbsp of the *ricotta cheese*-*fresh spinach* mixture. Arrange
      the stuffed shells in a single layer in the baking dish.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Pour the remaining marinara sauce over the stuffed *jumbo pasta shells*, ensuring they are mostly covered.
      Sprinkle generously with the shredded *mozzarella cheese* and grated *parmesan cheese*.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the *mozzarella cheese* and *parmesan cheese* are melted and bubbly and the
      marinara sauce is heated through. If desired, broil for the last 2-3 minutes for a golden-brown top.
  - step: 7
    action: >-
      Let the *jumbo pasta shells* rest for 5 minutes before serving. Serve hot, perhaps with a simple crisp romaine
      salad dressed with vinaigrette for a complete meal.
