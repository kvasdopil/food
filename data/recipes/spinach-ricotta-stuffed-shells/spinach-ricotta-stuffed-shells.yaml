instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Preheat oven to 190 degrees Celsius. Lightly grease a 23cm x 33cm baking
      dish with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. If using fresh spinach, quickly wilt
      it in a pan over medium heat, then squeeze out excess water and roughly
      chop. If using frozen, thaw and squeeze dry, then chop.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Cook the jumbo pasta shells according to package directions until al
      dente. Drain well and rinse with cold water to prevent sticking. Lay them
      out on a clean surface or baking sheet to cool slightly.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      In a large bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, wilted and chopped spinach,
      beaten egg, minced garlic, dried oregano, chopped parsley, 0.5 teaspoon
      salt, and 0.25 teaspoon black pepper. Mix thoroughly until all ingredients
      are well combined.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Spread half of the marinara sauce evenly over the bottom of the prepared
      baking dish. Carefully stuff each cooked pasta shell with approximately
      1-2 tablespoons of the ricotta-spinach mixture. Arrange the stuffed shells
      in a single layer in the baking dish.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Pour the remaining marinara sauce over the stuffed shells, ensuring they
      are mostly covered. Sprinkle generously with the shredded mozzarella
      cheese and grated Parmesan cheese.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly and the
      sauce is heated through. If desired, broil for the last 2-3 minutes for a
      golden-brown top.
  - step: 7
    action: >-
      Let the shells rest for 5 minutes before serving. Serve hot, perhaps with
      a simple crisp romaine salad dressed with vinaigrette for a complete meal.
