instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: Dice the *chicken breast* into small 1cm pieces.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add the diced
      chicken and cook until browned and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes.
      Season with salt and pepper.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      While the chicken cooks, finely chop the *chipotle peppers in adobo
      sauce*. In a small bowl, mix the chopped chipotles, the adobo sauce, the
      *finely diced red onion*, and the *minced garlic*.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Add the chipotle mixture to the cooked chicken in the pan. Stir well to
      coat the chicken and cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to
      meld. Remove from heat.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Lay out a *flour tortilla*. Sprinkle a quarter of the *grated cheddar
      cheese* on one half of the tortilla. Spoon a quarter of the chicken
      mixture over the cheese. Fold the other half of the tortilla over to form
      a semicircle. Repeat with the remaining tortillas, cheese, and chicken
      mixture.
  - step: 6
    action: >-
      Heat a clean pan over medium heat. Cook each assembled quesadilla for 2-3
      minutes per side, or until the tortilla is golden brown and crispy, and
      the cheese is melted and bubbly. You may need to cook them in batches.
  - step: 7
    action: >-
      While the quesadillas cook, prepare the guacamole. Mash the *ripe avocado*
      in a bowl. Squeeze in the juice from half the *lime*. Stir in the *chopped
      fresh coriander* and season with salt and pepper.
  - step: 8
    action: >-
      Cut each quesadilla into wedges. Serve immediately with the freshly made
      guacamole and remaining lime wedges.
