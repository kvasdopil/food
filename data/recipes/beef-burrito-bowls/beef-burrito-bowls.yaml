instructions:
  - step: 1
    action: >-
      Cook the *long-grain white rice*: Combine 200 g of long-grain white rice
      with 400 ml of water and a pinch of salt in a saucepan. Bring to a boil,
      then reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15-18 minutes, or until all
      water is absorbed. Remove from heat and let stand, covered, for 5 minutes.
      Fluff with a fork.
  - step: 2
    action: >-
      Prepare the beef mixture: While the rice cooks, heat a drizzle of olive
      oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add the *ground beef* and cook,
      breaking it up with a spoon, until browned, about 5-7 minutes. Drain any
      excess fat. Add the chopped *onion* and minced *garlic* to the pan,
      cooking until softened, about 3-4 minutes. Stir in the *chili powder*,
      *ground cumin*, and *dried oregano*, cooking for 1 minute until fragrant.
      Season with salt and black pepper to taste.
  - step: 3
    action: >-
      Combine and simmer: Stir the rinsed and drained *canned black beans*,
      drained *canned corn*, and *salsa* into the beef mixture. Bring to a
      gentle simmer and cook for 5-7 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. Keep
      warm over low heat.
  - step: 4
    action: >-
      Make the lime chips: While the beef mixture simmers, preheat your oven to
      180Â°C. Arrange the *corn tortillas* wedges on a baking sheet. Drizzle
      lightly with olive oil and sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Bake for 8-10
      minutes, or until golden and crispy. Squeeze juice from half a *lime* over
      the hot chips immediately after removing from the oven.
  - step: 5
    action: >-
      Assemble the bowls: Divide the cooked *long-grain white rice* among
      serving bowls. Top with generous portions of the beef and bean mixture.
      Garnish with chopped *fresh cilantro* and serve with the crispy *lime*
      chips on the side. Offer extra lime wedges for squeezing.
